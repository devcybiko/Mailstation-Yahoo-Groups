<p class="formattedBody">Going by spew.txt, changing the data at 0x20000 can let you add new<br>
app en=<br>
tries to the MS.  You do so by changing the first digit of this<br>
series of =<br>
bytes:<br>
<br>
02 00 02 00 01 00 01 5e   1c 18 01 01 01 20 a7 19<br>
<br>
Well this works =<br>
fine for one or two extra apps.  But upon trying to<br>
add a third app, I ran=<br>
across a problem.  I get three icons, but my<br>
third icon is now the same a=<br>
s my first one (on mine this is the Hello<br>
World app).  And running this th=<br>
ird one doesn't work, it simply<br>
returns to the main menu.  The first two a=<br>
pps run fine though.<br>
<br>
Has anyone deciphered this series of bytes to know wh=<br>
at they're for?<br>
Or is there the possibility that the MS just simply can't=<br>
handle more<br>
than 2 apps?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">I forgot to mention that if you clear out all the bytes except the<br>
first o=<br>
ne where you specify your number of apps, all the app icons<br>
end up the sam=<br>
e (your first app's), and none of them will execute<br>
(aka just returning to=<br>
the main menu).  Could be a piece to the<br>
puzzle.<br>

<br>
I was looking into my notes on the app directory (pg #08),<br>
and=<br>
I found out a bit more since I wrote the instructions<br>
in "spew.asm" file.=<br>
<br>
The first 4 bytes in page #08 are a header, where the<br>
first byte is a =<br>
count of the number of apps in dataflash.<br>
After the 4 byte header, there =<br>
are six byte records, one<br>
for each loaded app.  I don't know what all the =<br>
bytes<br>
mean, but the second byte is the dataflash page number<br>
where you pu=<br>
t the app, and the 6th byte is an app number.<br>
<br>
I think there is a max of 5=<br>
extra apps.<br>
<br>
App number prob should be at least #18, but I don't know<br>
fo=<br>
r sure.  I don't know what would happen if you used the<br>
number of some oth=<br>
er app (built in apps have numbers, too).<br>
<br>
I think the highest the app nu=<br>
mber is allowed to be is #1D,<br>
or maybe #1E.  (there is an internal app tab=<br>
le with 30 rows,<br>
but I don't remember right now if the first is app 00 or 0=<br>
1.)<br>
<br>
Going by the data you posted, the first dataflash app is<br>
#18, so I am =<br>
gonna guess that the last internal app is #17.<br>
AFAICT, just about every dif=<br>
ferent screen type is a<br>
different "app", even if the screens seem to be pa=<br>
rt of<br>
what you would normally call the same "app".<br>

My notes say 0308:4002 is "hex editor state", but I'm<br>
not sure that's rig=<br>

<br>
I filled in typical values above for th=<br>

Seems to work if<br>
you just leave them 00.<br>

I suppose anything is possible.  =<br>
My hunch is that the<br>

fetching it.  I would think, since it is binary data,<br>

If by data you mean the TV listin=<br>

I don't know if they reload the whole 16k page each time<br>
they update =<br>
data, or just the image data (what I named<br>
