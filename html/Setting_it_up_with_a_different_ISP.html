I wiped the ROM then,<br>
Press Power, Fn + Shift + T + Reset pin, then '3: F/A Tester' then<br>
'6: Flash test'. When done, press Back then Q. It then asks for Reset<br>
queries which you ignore as all was wiped any way. You'll then get:<br>
"Please create a new user account." press Enter.<br>
Then you fill in each field carefully:<br>

The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,<br>
but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the<br>
only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print<br>
in color.<br>
<br>
Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more<br>
security for locking you from getting in to work on it.<br>
<br>
It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself<br>
and move to a working account. The "special" email has<br>
MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the<br>
internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.<br>
<br>
Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these<br>
characters to be received by the machine.<br>
<br>
The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the<br>
serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special<br>
encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.<br>
<br>
You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink<br>
will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,<br>
and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special<br>
characters,<br>
which you won't see or be able to print out.<br>
<br>
You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using<br>
these<br>
mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???<br>
<br>
If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until<br>
Earthlink<br>
finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to<br>
there !!!<br>
<br>
As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!<br>

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent<br>
about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka<br>
"fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a<br>
time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-<br>
upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
An update:<br>
<br>
3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned<br>
back on despite<br>
those incompetent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation.<br>
That was all that was<br>
wrong with her original unit.<br>
<br>
Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no<br>
service, grief and<br>
frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board<br>
replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I<br>
ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different<br>
person.<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK<br>
and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a<br>
friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to<br>
print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a<br>
time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-<br>
upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it<br>
back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you<br>
pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she<br>
has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to<br>
fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which<br>
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.<br>
Take a look.<br>

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and<br>
locally including the "pinhole" reset) and the groups still refuse to<br>
function, which is what leads us to believe in the "bad flash memory<br>
sector" theory.  Maybe the whole memory needs to be reformatted, and<br>
that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).<br>

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry<br>
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll<br>
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.<br>
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.<br>

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!<br>

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the<br>
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not<br>
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may<br>
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me<br>
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access<br>
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope<br>
you got your mom all fixed up too.<br>

Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian<br>
vernacular. If a 'Group' worked, the others should if the others<br>
still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.<br>
Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and<br>
I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And<br>
I am.......<br>
Hey, I'm our organization's Guru and this is testing ME. And I beat<br>
you with a 2,182 km separation. Ha!<br>

I'm 900 miles from the machine.  However, I recall she had three<br>
groups set up.  Two of them still worked, but any attempt to access<br>
the third locked up the machine, requiring the "pinhole" reset.  I<br>
suggested she just abandon the "bad" group, rename it something<br>
similar, and start the bad group over.  Apparently, it wouldn't let<br>
them set up any new groups, and after the tech friend and the Indians<br>
finished messing with it, NONE of the groups would work anymore and<br>
it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to<br>
all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).<br>
As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"<br>
anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old<br>
non-geek, to tell exactly what's going on.<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which<br>
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.<br>
Take a look.<br>

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and<br>
locally including the "pinhole" reset) and the groups still refuse to<br>
function, which is what leads us to believe in the "bad flash memory<br>
sector" theory.  Maybe the whole memory needs to be reformatted, and<br>
that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).<br>

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry<br>
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll<br>
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.<br>
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.<br>

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!<br>

So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......<br>

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the<br>
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not<br>
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may<br>
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me<br>
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access<br>
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope<br>
you got your mom all fixed up too.<br>

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product<br>
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support<br>
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on<br>
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for<br>
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their<br>
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I<br>
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data<br>
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.<br>
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no<br>
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where<br>
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:<br>
<br>
User Name:<br>
Dial Up Number:<br>
E-mail address:<br>
E-mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SMTP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole<br>
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't<br>
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.<br>
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....<br>
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all<br>
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info<br>
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>
<br>
More later.....<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
back on despite<br>
That was all that was<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
service, grief and<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

My most sincere apologies. I forgot to trim my previous note and add:<br>
This applies to the Mivo 100 flavour of the Cidco DETI MailStation,<br>
but I'm sure there is a wiping trick of some sort somewhere for the<br>
350 that may accomplish the same thing. Maybe a variation on mine?<br>
If you can get to the Diag screen and do a flash test, that should<br>
get your Advanced settings open for input. To save yourself the time<br>
I took, remember to write down the sequences that didn't work!<br>
<br>
Attention Gurus out there.<br>
<br>
Is there a 'Settings, Advanced' page you can get to on the 350? Does<br>
it resemble what's below?<br>
<br>
I DID IT!!!!! E-mails From, To and Replies back and forth to my Mac<br>
and my Cell were ALL quite successful.<br>
<br>
I now feel confident enough to move my mother from Earthlink to<br>
BasicISP as Mid Maine is State wide only and Verizon seems to have<br>
their call centre in India, too which explains their lack of<br>
cooperation with my little request.<br>
<br>
Of the three ISP outfits that actually replied to me, only one<br>
finally came through. Offered a 30 day Money back guarantee, to boot!<br>
I wiped the ROM by:<br>
Press Power, Fn + Shift + T + Reset pin, then '3: F/A Tester' then<br>
'6: Flash test'. When done, press Back then Q. It then asks for Reset<br>
queries which you ignore as all was wiped anyway. You'll then get:<br>
"Please create a new user account." press Enter.<br>
Then you fill in each field VERY carefully as a single typo will mean<br>
you start over. The password won't be displayed:<br>

The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,<br>
but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the<br>
only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print<br>
in color.<br>
<br>
Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more<br>
security for locking you from getting in to work on it.<br>
<br>
It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself<br>
and move to a working account. The "special" email has<br>
MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the<br>
internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.<br>
<br>
Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these<br>
characters to be received by the machine.<br>
<br>
The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the<br>
serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special<br>
encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.<br>
<br>
You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink<br>
will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,<br>
and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special<br>
characters,<br>
which you won't see or be able to print out.<br>
<br>
You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using these<br>
mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???<br>
<br>
If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until<br>
Earthlink<br>
finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to<br>
there !!!<br>
<br>
As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!<br>

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product<br>
Life)<br>
spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support anything more<br>
than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on our own here. I<br>
just<br>
learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for bankruptcy this past January.<br>
My calls and faxes to them for their engineering assistance went<br>
unanswered<br>
and I expect the letter I posted to them a week ago will be coming back<br>
soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data<br>
are<br>
pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information. Start with<br>
'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no typos. You will<br>
most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where you'll need to type it<br>
all in just as you saw it:<br>
<br>
User Name:<br>
Dial Up Number:<br>
E-mail address:<br>
E-mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SMTP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole in<br>
the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't operational.<br>
Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test. When it's done press<br>
the Reset again to get back to the Diag.... screen. Press Q to return the<br>
machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all said<br>
they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info from them<br>
to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>
<br>
More later.....<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
An update:<br>
<br>
3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned<br>
back on despite<br>
those incompetent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation.<br>
That was all that was<br>
wrong with her original unit.<br>
<br>
Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no<br>
service, grief and<br>
frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.<br>
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
An update:<br>
<br>
3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned<br>
back on despite<br>
those incompetent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation.<br>
That was all that was<br>
wrong with her original unit.<br>
<br>
Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no<br>
service, grief and<br>
frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian<br>
vernacular. If a 'Group' worked, the others should if the others<br>
still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.<br>
Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and<br>
I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And<br>
I am.......<br>

I'm 900 miles from the machine.  However, I recall she had three<br>
groups set up.  Two of them still worked, but any attempt to access<br>
the third locked up the machine, requiring the "pinhole" reset.  I<br>
suggested she just abandon the "bad" group, rename it something<br>
similar, and start the bad group over.  Apparently, it wouldn't let<br>
them set up any new groups, and after the tech friend and the Indians<br>
finished messing with it, NONE of the groups would work anymore and<br>
it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to<br>
all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).<br>
As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"<br>
anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old<br>
non-geek, to tell exactly what's going on.<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which<br>

<br>
So has anyone had any luck in getting the 350 to work with a different<br>
ISP?<br>
<br>
I have read a few threads in this group about the 350, but the 100<br>
and other mailstations seem to migrate into the 350 discussion, which<br>
makes it very difficult to keep seperate.<br>
<br>
I thought that I had the instructions on a couple of different<br>
threads and after rereading them, i am no longer sure that they apply<br>
to the 350!<br>

I did, with a 100.<br>
I'd suggest, after my successful experimentation with my 100, that<br>
you try anything that takes you to its ROM test, or something to that<br>
effect.<br>
If you manage to get that done, the account data should be erased.<br>

Fill in the fields with the info I previously provided in this board<br>
that you get from BasicISP. That should work.<br>

The setup for the model 100 is NOT the same as the Model 350.<br>
<br>
What you can easily do on the 100 you can NOT do on the 350.<br>
<br>
So far, I have not found or heard of anyone getting a Model 350 to<br>
change and work on a new ISP or change the "Account Data"<br>
in it.<br>
<br>
If you do a ROM test on the Model 350, it wipes out ALL the<br>
data on the unit, and it will NOT run anymore !!!!  Be warned !!!!<br>
