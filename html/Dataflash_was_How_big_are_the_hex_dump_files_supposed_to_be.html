The dataflash (28SF040) has 2048 sectors of 256 bytes each.<br>
<br>
And it is mapped into slot #4000 1 page of 16k (or 64 sectors) at<br>
a time.<br>
<br>
When any particular page of 64 dataflash sectors<br>
is mapped to slot #4000,<br>
The 1st sector is at #4000<br>
The 2nd sector is at #4100<br>
. . . . .<br>
The 64rd sector is at #7F00<br>
<br>
Try thinking of it from this perspective:  If there is not<br>
16k of dataflash occupying the #4000-7FFF memory space,<br>
what else is???<br>
<br>
You can think of the #4000-7FFF "slot" as a sliding window on a<br>
much larger address space.  The window is 16k high, and it<br>
slides up and down in 16k increments.<br>
<br>
You could design a system that slid the window on 256 byte<br>
increments, and then you could put any arbitrary sector at<br>
#4000-40FF.  In that case, you would need 6 more bits of<br>
"page" address.<br>
