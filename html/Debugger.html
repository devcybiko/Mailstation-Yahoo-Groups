<p class="formattedBody">I have uploaded a current copy of my remote debugger<br>
to the files section (a DOS executable, mailbug.exe).<br>
<br>
It includes code to flash the remote target code<br>
(MBOOT/MBUG) into a mailstation.  I have tested<br>
it on version 2.22r and 2.53yr.  It should work with<br>
2.54, too.  I don't know about any of the others,<br>
but it might.  You need a parallel laplink cable to<br>
use it.  I think a windows DCC (direct cable connect)<br>
is essentially the same thing.<br>
<br>
If you don't feel adventurous, it should be possible<br>
to make a version that is more likely to work on<br>
unknown versions, it just is not done yet.<br>
<br>
It also includes a "RAM" target, that emulates only the<br>
mailstation ROM (you don't need to connect to real mailstation).<br>
This will allow "on the fly" disassembly of the rom code,<br>
including comments, but not execution.  (unzip don<br>
hamiltons dump in subdir "hamilton", and debugger<br>
will convert it to .rom files.)<br>
<br>
Installing the MBUG target will erase most of the<br>
mailstation code, but the low level stuff is preserved.<br>
MBUG will allow on the fly disassembly, uploading to<br>
ram, and executing, among other things.  Breakpoints<br>
still do not work.<br>
<br>
There is also an extremely simple "hello world" program<br>
(both .asm & .hex). It makes a call to a system routine,<br>
and displays on the LCD.<br>
<br>
The source code is included for the remote part, with<br>
an explanation of how it (remote) works.  The source<br>
for the PC side is not included, 'cause it is not ready yet.<br>
There is no documentation on using it yet either, but<br>
the menu should help.<br>
<br>
It uses the same code I posted earlier (unit_tribbles.pas)<br>
but with new timeout code that should work regardless<br>
of cpu speed now.  And it is still a DOS app (just be glad<br>
it is not still CP/M!!!).  If anyone knows how to turn<br>
tribbles.pas into a win32 device driver, then I could<br>
make a win32 version.<br>
<br>
I only included comment file for page #00 of the rom<br>
for now.  I have a lot more, but it is taking time to get<br>
everything in order.  I hope to post more soon.  But I<br>
wanted to get something out now.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I have forgot something....<br>
<br>
Oh, if something goes wrong, you could toast your<br>
mailstation.  I now have 4 units with unbootable rom code.<br>
<br>
And I would highly advise not to leave the laplink<br>
connected between your PC and the mailstation when<br>
booting the PC.<br>

I'm not sure how well such a clip would work, given the low profile of a<br>
TSOP flash part, but if it does work wouldn't that mean one could<br>
reprogram a toasted mailstation flash chip without desoldering the part?<br>

OUCH!  Did you see the price on those?  You could<br>
buy 20 or 30 mailstations for that price!  :-)<br>
<br>
I am sure you can rescue a misflashed mailstation<br>
without removing the chip.  It's just not gonna be<br>
real easy.<br>
<br>
I was thinking that the ram chip would be the easiest<br>
place to get at the bus, like in Don Hamilton's pic<br>
in the groups photo section.  Just solder wires to it!<br>
<br>
I don't know about just driving the bus and flashing,<br>
but what I was thinking was to connect the data bus<br>
to the data pins on a pc parallel port, and maybe the<br>
/rd or /ce, or an address line or two, to the status<br>
pins.  You would need to cut the /ce to the flash, and<br>
pull the flash side of it high, and monitor the other<br>
side of it.<br>
<br>
Then, with a fast pc, emulate the codeflash.  Send<br>
code for the cpu to execute, and have it load<br>
whatever you want into ram, then jump to it.<br>
After your arbitrary code was running from<br>
ram, disconnect the pc from the bus, and reconnect<br>
the /ce to the codeflash chip.<br>
<br>
Then the code in ram can flash whatever it needs to<br>
into the codeflash.  This technique would<br>
give you access to any device, not just<br>
a trashed mailstation.  You could even use<br>
it to access/download the rom before erasing<br>
any of the unknown ms firmware versions.<br>
<br>
Maybe there is some socket with the right pitch<br>
to mate with that ram chip?  It wouldn't need to<br>
snap on, you could just hold it on for the instant<br>
it would take to load the ram.  A through-hole<br>
type rather than surface mount might work<br>
even better (use the solder side pins to contact<br>
the ram, and solder your wires to the component side).<br>
<br>
(It might be easier to just piggyback a similar<br>
packaged preprogrammed rom on to the ram, with<br>
its /cs connected to the codeflash /cs, but I don't<br>
have such a chip, or a programmer for it.)<br>
<br>
Anybody able to identify the type of package<br>
for the ram chip?  I am by no means an expert<br>
on surface mount packages.  Is it a SOP?  SSOP??<br>
TSOP-II???<br>
<br>
Whats the difference between all those anyhow???<br>
The fact that different manufacturers seem<br>
to use different names for the same packages<br>
doesn't help.<br>

Well with shipping on each one I think it would be more like 10 or 15,<br>
but yeah. It ain't free.<br>
<br>
But then such a solution would work in all cases, no matter how hose the<br>
MS, and whether or not the built-in flash routine is accessible. Only<br>
one of us would have to own one, and could reprogram MS's for others.<br>
<br>
I heard about this particular test clip from someone that reprograms<br>
firmware on certain tv receivers.<br>

Satellite tv receivers. Every once in a while they change some codes,<br>
and the modders have to reprogram their firmware.<br>
