<hr><h3>Subject: How to dump your ROM (without a soldering iron)</h3>
<p class="from">From: "Cyrano Jones" &lt;cyranojones_lalp@...></p>
<p class="date">Jul 20, 2005</p>
<p class="formattedBody">I posted a file (Files>mailbug>Spew.txt) with<br>
a mailstation app named "Spew", that sends<br>
the mailstations firmware out the parallel port<br>
when it is selected from mailstation menu.<br>
<br>
Spew.txt is really the assembly listing spew.lst,<br>
I renamed it so it is viewable with web browsers.<br>
I am posting the assembly listing rather than<br>
spew.asm or spew.rom, because the listing has<br>
the comments, the code, and the addresses in a<br>
human readable form.  It needs to be entered<br>
in hex on the mailstation keyboard (about 40-50 bytes).<br>
<br>
There are instructions in the file on how to<br>
poke it into your mailstation dataflash with<br>
the mailstations built in hex editor.<br>
<br>
I'm not posting the assembly listing here, because it<br>
is too wide, and would get mangled by yahoo.  But<br>
the source file is narrower, so I will paste it below.<br>
If viewing on website, you can line columns up with<br>
the "reply" button, without actually sending the reply.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
; NOTE: You can't dump the rom after mboot or sboot is flashed,<br>
;       because most of the rom is gone by then.<br>
;<br>
; This is code to be poked into dataflash on unit with yahoo<br>
; features active.<br>
; HEY, it seems to work on units *without* yahoo feature, too!!!!<br>
; (4.05E for instance.)<br>
; It's purpose is to dump the coderom out of the parallel port,<br>
; using the tribble code in page #01.<br>
;<br>
; *** One catch to using this is that it requires mailbug<br>
; *** version > 0.0.3, with the "inhale" function, to catch<br>
; *** the data.  And that version is not quite ready yet.<br>
; *** But you do not need it to enter this app into your<br>
; *** mailstation.  In fact, if you want to dump your rom,<br>
; *** you *have to* enter this in hex on the mailstation<br>
; *** keyboard.  That is because in order for mailbug to<br>
; *** write anything to dataflash, mbug needs to be loaded,<br>
; *** and loading mbug requires flashing sboot or mboot, and<br>
; *** flashing anything (to codeflash) will erase your rom.<br>
; ***   You have to do this BEFORE INSTALLING SBOOT!<br>
<br>
bsendbyte equ #802D ; raises busy & sends byte.<br>
; We use the existing sendbyte from original update code.<br>
; This means codeflash page #01 needs to be banked in to<br>
; slot8000 before calling bsendbyte.<br>
<br>
done      equ #0000 ; Gotta go somewhere when done, we reboot.<br>
; Mailstation will call eventhandler 3 or 4 times when you<br>
; select the new application, and we only want to exec once,<br>
; so we do not return at end, we reboot after first "event".<br>
<br>
; STEP 1)<br>
; This is data from dataflash page #08, sector #00 (which<br>
; translates to a raw address of 020000), of a mailstation<br>
; with two apps:<br>
;<br>
; 020000  02 00 02 00 01 00 01 5e   1c 18 01 01 01 20 a7 19<br>
;<br>
; This is the key to enabling added apps!!!<br>
; At least first byte above is needed, it seems to be count<br>
; of apps (2 in this case).  You need to poke it into dataflash<br>
; with hex editor at raw address 020000.<br>
;<br>
; Modify the first byte to match number of apps, including<br>
; new one.  If your mailstation already has app(s), and you<br>
; want to overwite one of them, you can leave this data as is,<br>
; and skip this step.  I don't know what the rest are, but those<br>
; 16 bytes are the only data in dataflash pg #08, sector #00.<br>
;<br>
; If you inc that first byte, without doing steps 2 or 3, you<br>
; should enable blank (or giberish) icons in the menu (under<br>
; yahoo, or extras).<br>
;<br>
; *** Enter Test mode with vulcan nerve pinch while booting:<br>
;     &lt;func>&lt;shift>&lt;t>, or &lt;func>&lt;size>&lt;t> or on the newer<br>
;     models, &lt;func>&lt;q>&lt;a> followed by "qa781206" without<br>
;     the quotes, of course.<br>
;<br>
; *** Enter Hex Viewer mode with &lt;shift>&lt;f5>.<br>
;<br>
; *** Enable Hex Edit mode by entering "G710304x&lt;enter>" without<br>
;     quotes of course.  This is a "go" to a nonexising sector,<br>
;     and it will leave viewer on last sector of dataflash.<br>
;<br>
; *** Edit dataflash page #08 as described above. G020000 will<br>
;     get you to the right sector. &lt;ctrl>&lt;s> will enter edit mode<br>
;     for current sector.  Edit the data.  &lt;ctrl>&lt;s> will leave<br>
;     edit mode and save to dataflash.  You need to leave edit<br>
;     mode before moving to next sector.<br>
<br>
; STEP 2}<br>
; This is the start of our new app.  If your mailstation has<br>
; no existing "apps", then you would poke this into page #00<br>
; of dataflash (raw address 000000).<br>
;<br>
; If you already have say 2 existing apps, they are probably<br>
; in dataflash pages #00 & #01 respectively.  In that case you<br>
; would put this in page #02 of dataflash (008000).<br>
;<br>
; When using dataflash page #00, this goes at raw address 000000.<br>
; When using dataflash page #01, this goes at raw address 004000.<br>
; When using dataflash page #02, this goes at raw address 008000.<br>
;<br>
; (iow, in raw addresses, first app is at 000000, second at 004000,<br>
; and third at 008000.)<br>
;<br>
; The JP instruction is the only thing in this part that is<br>
; absolutely necessary, if you can live with a captionless<br>
; menu entry.  The icon is gonna be blank anyways.<br>
;<br>
; *** Use hex editor to "go" to your address (G000000 or G004000<br>
;     or G008000).  This address corresponds to #4000 in the<br>
;     following app, no matter what page you are using.<br>
;<br>
; *** Enter edit mode, enter at least the bytes for the JP of<br>
;     the following code, and save the sector.  Goto step 3.<br>
<br>
ORG  #4000        ; This is *always* #4000, regardless of<br>
; what page you use.<br>

icon:<br>
; I haven't figured out the icon format yet, but it's not needed.<br>
; Icon data would go here, followed by app data (news, weather,<br>
; or tv).<br>
; Just leave this data as it is, and we will skip ahead to the last<br>
; sector in this same page.<br>
<br>
; STEP 3)<br>
; I don't think it matters exactly where this next part<br>
; sits in dataflash, as long as the JP in step two above can<br>
; find it.  We will put it at the end of the page, 'coz that's<br>
; where the mailstation apps put it.<br>
;<br>
; If using dataflash page #00, this goes at raw address 003f00.<br>
; If using dataflash page #01, this goes at raw address 007f00.<br>
; If using dataflash page #02, this goes at raw address 00bf00.<br>
;<br>
; *** Use "go" command with appropriate address matching address<br>
;     used in step 2.<br>
;<br>
; *** Edit mode, enter the following 37 bytes of code, save.<br>
;<br>
; *** Quit Hex Editor with &lt;back> key.<br>
;<br>
; *** Leave Test mode with &lt;q> key.<br>
;<br>
; *** The mailstation will reboot, pick "no clear", and then<br>
;     check if you have a new app listed in your menu under<br>
