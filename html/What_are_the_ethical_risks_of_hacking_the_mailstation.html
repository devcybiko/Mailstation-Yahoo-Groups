<p class="formattedBody">I can think of two ethical issues related to hacking the ms, one that<br>
I can ignore, and one that I can't.<br>
<br>
1) I'm sure there was something in the license agreement about not<br>
reverse engineering the ms, but I look on this as a fascinating<br>
puzzle. There may be so much code that I will tire of trying to<br>
understand it before I ever do, but for now, it is a diversion. I<br>
don't have a problem with hacking an obsolete device as a personal<br>
challenge. Should I feel more unethical about this?<br>
<br>
2) I'm also sure that there are some ms users who know nothing about<br>
computers and are just thrilled to get an email from a dear<br>
friend. I have a big problem with contributing to their frustration<br>
and disillusionment when someone figures out how to craft an email<br>
that will change the ms settings or disable it. Is it possible to<br>
collaborate on a hack and still protect the innocent?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">The only thing the "Agreement" relates to is use of the service.  I<br>
see nothing in the paperwork that says "Thou shalt not hack firmware"<br>
unless it's using their service unauthorized.<br>
<br>
Someone please correct me if they see something I missed.<br>
<br>
that<br>
