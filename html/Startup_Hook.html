<p class="formattedBody">So since I can hook/replace the interrupt fairly easily via<br>
software,<br>
I t=<br>
hought it might be worth trying to hook the startup procedure<br>
too.  This w=<br>
ay one could test code that they might one day decide to<br>
flash onto codefl=<br>
ash page 0, without so much of the risk to bricking<br>
the thing by a silly m=<br>
istake.  Only problem is that this of course<br>
means flashing it to some deg=<br>
ree in order to place the hook.<br>
<br>
There appears to be 33 empty bytes at the =<br>
start of page 0.   Now I<br>
know that these are probably left that way in cas=<br>
e a RST command is<br>
sent.  But are these ever even used by the MS?  That se=<br>
ems to be the<br>
real kicker here.  If at any point they do get executed, I'd=<br>
be in<br>
trouble.  We know it sets interrupt mode 1 at startup, so at least =<br>
<br>
they'd never get triggered in that manner.<br>
<br>
But, assuming they're never us=<br>
ed, it should be easy to make a<br>
signature test on a section in ram, and if=<br>
it verifies, then you<br>
jump<br>
to your code in ram.  If the bytes didn't ver=<br>
ify, then normal<br>
Mailstation startup would carry on instead.  This means y=<br>
ou could<br>
use<br>
a normal Mailstation Yahoo-style app to load your code, then=<br>
as long<br>
as the power was never removed, your code should remain intact un=<br>
til<br>
overwritten or power is lost.  So you'd be able to reboot the MS and<br>
=<br>
test your startup code, and if for whatever reason it had a problem,<br>
you'd=<br>
just have to pull the power to kill the ram contents.<br>
<br>
33 bytes isn't a lo=<br>
t to work in, but it seems to be enough with a<br>
couple to spare for doing a=<br>
three byte signature.  The MS only does<br>
two bytes for checking its own da=<br>
ta at startup, but since this is<br>
code, I figure three might be better.  Wh=<br>
o knows!  I mostly just<br>
decided on three to use my initials.  ;)  I figure=<br>
this should do<br>
the<br>
trick:<br>
<br>
org #0000<br>
<br>
di				; disable interrupts, in=<br>
<br>
case<br>
we jump here<br>
<br>
ld	a, 1			; set ram page 1 into<br>
slot8000<br>
out	(#08=<br>
), a<br>
out	(#07), a<br>
<br>
ld	hl, #8003		; Test first byte<br>
ld	a, SIGBYTE1<br>
cp	=<br>
(hl)<br>
jr	nz, code_end<br>
<br>
inc	hl			; Test second byte<br>
ld	a, SIGBYTE2<br>
cp	(h=<br>
l)<br>
jr	nz, code_end<br>
<br>
inc	hl			; Test third byte<br>
ld	a, SIGBYTE3<br>
cp	(hl)<br>
=<br>
jr	nz, code_end<br>
<br>
jp	#8000			; Code seems good, jump to<br>
it<br>
<br>
code_end:	=<br>
; Code not valid, normal boot<br>
<br>
This fits into 30 bytes. It assumes you =<br>
load your code at #8000 on<br>
ram<br>
page 1 on slot8000, with a JP taking the f=<br>
irst three bytes, and then<br>
the next three being your signature.  But that =<br>
can be changed around<br>
to suit one's needs of course.<br>
<br>
But again, the worry=<br>
is the RST bytes.  If I fill them up, and then<br>
it executes one at some im=<br>
portant point, I might possibly have<br>
bricked it.  So I'm mostly wondering =<br>
if it was ever confirmed as to<br>
their usage.  It just seems like there'd re=<br>
ally be no reason for them<br>
to ever do so, considering they can jump to #00=<br>
00 for the same<br>
effect.<br>

Not quite wysiwyg, huh???  :-)<br>
<br>
=<br>
On the group web site there is (now) an option to view<br>
messages with a fix=<br>
ed-width font, which puts the<br>
message inside &lt;pre> &lt;/pre> tags.<br>
<br>
That will=<br>
make columns line up again.<br>
<br>
To bad you can't just select that when you po=<br>

But if you use the rich text option to compose a<br>
message, I think you c=<br>
an force message to keep<br>
cols lined up.<br>
<br>
It used to be you had to hit reply=<br>
button, and<br>
quoted msg would have the cols lined up in the<br>
reply box.  So=<br>
Yahoo has always been keeping<br>
the original (correctly formatted) text.  It=<br>
's<br>
just that they assume formatting does not matter,<br>
a bad assumption, part=<br>
icularly on a programming<br>
oriented group!<br>
