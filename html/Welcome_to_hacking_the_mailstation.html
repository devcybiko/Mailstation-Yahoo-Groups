<p class="formattedBody">Welcome all who wish to find information about the mailstation.<br>
<br>
This groups has been set up as a central location for technical<br>
information. The file and photo areas were missing with other locations.<br>
<br>
I know its been years in the coming, but Ill start off with the old<br>
files I created of the ROM dump.<br>
<br>
I will also include pdf files of the components I have found.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any technical information t share, please post here and<br>
Ill add it to the files/photos lists.<br>
<br>
thanks<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Thanks for setting up the group and uploading the files. I am looking<br>
forward to figuring out how the mailstation works and then<br>
extending it to do some other interesting things. I have several<br>
questions, but I'll use them to start some new threads.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

Yes, thanks for setting this up!<br>
<br>
I have been tinkering with my mailstation for about a year now.<br>
It probably would have just got stuck away in a box, if not for the<br>
motivation provided by hamilton's soldering iron, and rogblake's<br>
disassembler.  (I'm not sure if this is thanks, or blame!!!)<br>
<br>
I had studied rogblake's work, and thought I had it figgered out.<br>
But after much frustration trying to get the thing into reflash mode,<br>
I broke out MY soldering iron and hacked in a rom socket.  (If I<br>
post pictures, you will understand why it's called hacking!)  I<br>
figured if I couldn't get in the back door, I would just build<br>
a new front door.  With a door-man that worked for *me*!<br>
<br>
So, I made a few test progs, and determined the address and polarity<br>
of the printer data port bits.  Then I modified a remote debug rom I<br>
had made over 10 years ago, to work with that port.  Now I could<br>
put the beast through it's paces, under the control of my trusty<br>
CP/M system (did I mention it was written over 10 years ago?)<br>
<br>
Anyways, my goal is to use the ms for something more interesting<br>
than email.  One idea was to add a barcode reader, and create a<br>
sort of inventory device.  I also like the idea of porting CP/M<br>
to it.<br>

Would you post what you learned about the printer port, and what you<br>
learned about re-flashing the memories?<br>
<br>
Also, do you still have a copy of RogBlake's disassembly? I lost<br>
mine, but I recall that it had some tags on the functions in page 00.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Hi,<br>
<br>
Sorry to take so long responding.<br>
<br>
What I know about the printer port, (and most of the<br>
other ports) is in the thread "ms/z80 hacking" at<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowPost&Board=mswhatever&Post=77">(URL)</a><br>
There is also info on the banking of the memory, and a<br>
pinout for the cpu.<br>
Did anybody see this???<br>
<br>
As far as the disassembly, I'm not sure how earthlink would feel about<br>
it being posted here.  Some info on addresses in reflash code is on<br>
the other board in the thread "just deals mailstations", as well as<br>
rogblakes email address, if he is still using it.<br>
<br>
I am wondering if it would be better to use that board for<br>
discussion, and this one for files/etc???<br>
<br>
And as for reflashing, that involves ethical considerations that I am<br>
unsure of at this point.  I would really like to add functionality,<br>
not cut earthlink out of the picture.<br>

I posted a couple scans of my hardware in the photo section.<br>
You can rearrange or delete as  you see fit.<br>
<br>
Would it be better to post files to the list in the future?<br>

I do not think earthlink cares one way or another.<br>
<br>
The few people here that can hack the hardware, I am sure does not<br>
impact their bottom line.<br>
<br>
Now if someone ever figured out how to  externally re-load code, so<br>
any non-tech type can reflash their roms. That would be cutting them out.<br>
<br>
I had always thought the posting about $100 to anyone who can reflash<br>
thier MS was posted by someone at earthlink. ( we have a $100 bill for<br>
you, just give us your name and address )<br>
<br>
I see two dozen people here, and maybe a few hundred on<br>
linux-hacker.net, thats just not enough to make/break anyone.<br>
<br>
The MS devices are not really selling anyway. ( otherwise they would<br>
not be giving them away at OfficeMax)<br>
<br>
But, If some does find a way to reflash their MS.<br>
<br>
Please post here :-).<br>
