What address did you put your app at?<br>
<br>
Did you also edit the "app di=<br>
rectory" at 0x020000 in the dataflash?<br>
<br>
I realize my documentation is rathe=<br>
r sketchy, and I am not<br>
very familiar with documentation for FYOS.....<br>
<br>
...=<br>
.OK, I downloaded fyos doc, skimmed thru it, and I have to<br>
say, large hunks=<br>
of it bear a striking resemblance to my docs.<br>
<br>
It seems what fyos calls an=<br>
"app record" is what I would call<br>
an "app directory" entry.  So, I will as=<br>
sume you have not<br>
entered the actual app code yet, and are just wanting to=<br>
see<br>
if you can add an empty selectable item to the "extras" menu.<br>
(by the =<br>
way, if your mailstation has the "yahoo" folder, the<br>
new app will appear th=<br>
ere, and not in extras.)<br>
<br>
So, you need to edit page 0x08 of the dataflash, =<br>
which is at<br>
raw address 020000<br>
(i fergit how many leading zeroes are displ=<br>
ayed in mailstation's<br>
hex editor.)  you want to make it look like this:<br>
<br>
0=<br>
20000  01 00 01 00 00 00 00 00   00 18 00 00 00 00 00 00<br>
