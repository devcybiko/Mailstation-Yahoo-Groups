<br>
I feel really bad asking this, because I'm sure based on the title =<br>
of this thread that it has been answered a thousand times before.  However,=<br>
I had the fortune of snagging a Mailstation 150 (V4.05D Earthlink model) f=<br>
rom a thrift store for my 90-year-old grandmother to use.  This was great s=<br>
ince I had already tried to get her to use a computer but could not get her=<br>
beyond clicking the mouse and moving it at the same time.  With a Mailstat=<br>
ion, she can just correspond; simple.<br>
<br>
I had the misfortune of calling Eart=<br>
hlink support and talking to one of their snooty Indians (I don't know what=<br>
his problem was, I'm a paying Earthlink cable customer).  Anyway, I just c=<br>
alled them to ask for an SMTP server that was not requiring authorization (=<br>
since I doubt the Mailstation supports it).  He practically spat at me the =<br>
smtp.mailstation.com server before I could get him to understand I am diali=<br>
ng in to Earthlink dial-up with it.  I have successfully dialed in and been=<br>
able to retrieve messages from the POP server, but can not manage to send =<br>
any messages (Get a server busy error after already connected, I assume it =<br>
is bad authentication, no port 587).<br>
<br>
I have already done the Fn+D reset,=<br>
pull plug to get into the new account setup, but don't want to keep doing =<br>
that every time I configure it wrong.  Below are the settings I currently h=<br>
ave, could somebody please tell me what I have set wrong?<br>
