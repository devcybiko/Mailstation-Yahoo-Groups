what *I* would like to do is re-blast the system to make it a<br>
gle board computer, with (to start) machine code entry,<br>

, then compile and run.<br>
<br>
Blast away!  But unless you are a reeeeeally good =<br>
programmer, and<br>
won't need to reflash a second (or 498th) time, you will wa=<br>
nt to<br>
be careful to not erase the reflash code.  :-)<br>
<br>
In the files section=<br>
there is a remote debugger (mailbug) which is<br>
still a work in "progress" (=<br>
ha ha ha).  The currently posted<br>
version (0.0.3, I think) will let you ins=<br>
tall a program called<br>
"sboot" into the mailstation codeflash.  After sboot =<br>
is flashed,<br>
mailbug will use it (sboot) to load the remote half of the debu=<br>
gger,<br>
called "mbug" into mailstation RAM.  Together, mailbug and mbug<br>
give =<br>
you access to the mailstation hardware.  You can load code<br>
into the RAM and=<br>
execute it, or flash it somewhere in codeflash.<br>
<br>
With sboot flashed into y=<br>
our codeflash, you will need to keep<br>
your mailstation connected to your PC =<br>
(via parallel laplink cable),<br>
because all sboot knows how to do is load mbu=<br>
g over laplink.<br>
You can test your code in ram, or flash it to high codeflas=<br>
h<br>
page, but you will need the PC and mailbug to execute it.<br>
<br>
You could alwa=<br>
ys overwrite sboot with a jump to your new code<br>
after you've tested it, but=<br>
then, unless you leave some kind of<br>
back door, you won't be able to flash =<br>
any newer version of<br>
your code.<br>
<br>
I was kicking around various ideas on how =<br>
a next version of sboot<br>
would work, (in particular I wanted it to both be a=<br>
ble to boot<br>
directly to your new code without PC attached, and still give =<br>
<br>
mailbug access if PC was attached), when I figured out enough<br>
about how th=<br>
e mailstation apps work to write a simple app.<br>
<br>
I wrote an app that just du=<br>
mped the codeflash over the laplink.<br>
Pretty cool!  (At least I thought so.)=<br>
The only problem was<br>
I had to enter it via the mailstations hex editor.  =<br>
Why not<br>
use mailbug to load it, you may ask.  Because installing<br>
sboot enta=<br>
ils erasing the mailstation codeflash.  And you can't<br>
dump it after it's er=<br>
ased.  :-)<br>
<br>
Mailbug, in addition to the remote debug type of functions,<br>
has=<br>
a few functions that work with stock mailstation (read<br>
serial number, refl=<br>
ash code, load splash screen data).<br>
I started to add function to catch the =<br>
dump over laplink,<br>
but before I got it polished up, I decided a better<br>
id=<br>
ea would be to just load a version of sboot as an app.<br>
I actually poked i=<br>
n a shortened version of sboot, about<br>
150 bytes, with the hex editor.  It =<br>
worked, sort of.  But<br>
entering with hex editor was kind of tedious.<br>
<br>
Then =<br>
I had a brainstorm!  Why not embed the app in the splash<br>
screen data!!!  Th=<br>
en I'd only need to type enough bytes<br>
with hex editor (in the app space) to=<br>
jump to the splash screen!<br>
That works, but there is still a bit of work to=<br>
do to get<br>
mailbug to sync up with the "bootapp".<br>
<br>
I got side-tracked from =<br>
that a couple of months ago, when<br>
I found an example showing how to control=<br>
the parallel port<br>
from windows, (theoretically including XP).  So, for<br>
the=<br>
last several weeks, I have been converting mailbug<br>
to a win32 application.=<br>
Just about 3 days ago, I got<br>
this version to "talk to the port", but I'v=<br>
e only tested<br>
under 98 so far.  The dll is supposed to work with any<br>
versi=<br>
on of windows, I just don't have NT, 2000, or XP.<br>
<br>
There is still a whole l=<br>
ot to do to get it working with all<br>
the functionality of the DOS version.  =<br>
Things like project<br>
selection, and file selection were somewhat crude in la=<br>
st<br>
version, but they use standard open dialogs now.  Yay.<br>
<br>
hanks for the work done up til now, I'm<br>
of work done on this<br>
