I have posted scans of what you see when you receive the Yahoo special<br>
'messages'. Too bad they dumped this service. Perhaps we can figure<br>
out how these messages were formatted one day?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">From what I understood it wasnt exactly dumped, just<br>
not supported. (they would set you up, but if you<br>
didnt get them oh well). I do belive that it comes as<br>
some sort of attachment to an e-mail. If you know<br>
someone who gets them, go to their earthlink webmail<br>
and you should be able to view the source of the<br>
e-mail.<br>
<br>
I dont have any samples, just saw it once :(<br>

Cool, I was wondering what the yahoo data looked like.<br>
I have several ms's with the yahoo feature, but none with<br>
any data saved.<br>
<br>
I do have one with the MyCidco feature, and data for tv &<br>
weather, and it looks almost identical, (where yours<br>
says "yahoo", mine says "mycidco").  The format for the data<br>
screens looks the same.  It seems a sure bet now that<br>
they really are the same feature (and underlying<br>
mechanisms are same).  Oh yeah, the date of the info<br>
saved in mine is Jan 6, 2005.<br>
<br>
If anybody here has an account with these features active,<br>
it would be great if you could capture one of the "clipmail"<br>
messages (I am assuming that is how data is sent), and post<br>
it here.<br>
<br>
The big question is whether they use the "security key"<br>
with this data.<br>
<br>
The data for the mycidco tv & weather is stored in the<br>
first two pages of the dataflash, and it's stored as<br>
*executable* code.<br>
<br>
That means if we figure out how to load tv listings,<br>
we know how to execute arbitrary code.<br>
<br>
See Message 282 for everything I know about the format<br>
of the mycidco data in the dataflash.<br>
If you hit the reply button while viewing msg 282,<br>
the column formating will be fixed in the reply window.<br>
