<p class="formattedBody">Well as a proof of concept I ported CamelForth to the Tandy WP-2, a<br>
Z80 based word processor, not too different from the MS. I did the<br>
WP-2 since I've been planning it for a while and it has a built in<br>
serial-connected  disk driver that I happen to have a good emulator for.<br>
<br>
I had to do a few things:<br>
<br>
a) Use the Z180 port of CamelForth, since it can compile with the<br>
Zilog assembler/linker. The original Z80 CamelForth is compatible with<br>
some CP/M assembler.<br>
<br>
b) Remove hardware specific stuff in the Z180 port. Nothing difficult,<br>
just deleting some things.<br>
<br>
c) Create a WP-2 compatible "header" for the file.<br>
<br>
d) Implement EMIT, KEY, and KEY? EMIT outputs a character to the<br>
terminal, KEY blocks reading a character from the terminal, and KEY?<br>
just scans for the currently depressed key.<br>
<br>
e) Use the HEX2BIN utility of sourceforge to convert Intel hex to binary.<br>
<br>
f) Load it up and test my implementations of EMIT, KEY, and KEY?<br>
<br>
Anyway, it works! The MS shouldn't be too different, at least if we<br>
are using its routines. But for stand-alone (ie no dependence on Cidco<br>
code) we'd need a little bit more, since we'd be generating characters<br>
ourselves, and we'd have to do all the bootloader stuff. But it might<br>
be easier to experiment with that kind of thing if we just get<br>
CamelForth booting first, then we can play with all the hardware<br>
interactively. I have some ideas for a simple flash file system if we<br>
get tired of loading code at the keyboard or over the parallel port.<br>
<br>
CamelForth is about 6K, there are instructions burning it to ROM<br>
available (so it doesn't create any variables in program space). Or we<br>
could just load and run it in RAM for now via MAILBUG.<br>

Cool!<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Does the z180 code run on a z80?  If it does, what makes it a z180<br>
port?<br>
Just curious.<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Did you use existing terminal routines in the WP-2?<br>
<br>
So far, all I have found in ms is the raw scancode key buffer<br>
routines.<br>
Won't be "too hard" (heh, there I go again) to convert to ascii.<br>
<br>
On the output side it might be a little more work.  I have some<br>
quick and dirty code that writes whole strings to LCD.  I used<br>
the existing message display function from the update code.<br>
Its easy to set the line it writes on, but it always wants to write<br>
starting at the left edge of the screen.<br>
<br>
Probably the most straight forward way to do a better<br>
terminal would be to restore the font page in codeflash,<br>
and then use the LCD code in page #00 of the codeflash.<br>
But I don't know if there is a "text mode" cursor.  Might<br>
have to keep track of that ourselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mailbug can load intel .hex files!  :-)<br>
(It's one of the few thing that did work right in version posted.<br>
Is anyone waiting for the fixed version?)<br>
<br>
<br>
It's always fun when "it works"!!!<br>
<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
Yeah, it seems like you would need to store your program files<br>
somewhere, even if the forth interpreter is in rom.  And a text<br>
editor to write programs, or is that part of forth already?<br>

I haven't seen anything special. The only thing about this port that I<br>
needed was that it assembles with the Zilog assembler/linker instead of<br>
some CP/M assembler/linker. Seems to run fine on a regular Z80 chip.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes. And of course now I'm finding that the charout is buggy on some<br>
WP-2 ROMs when you get to the screen scroll. So I may have to do it<br>
myself at least for the last character on screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah that sounds like not a big deal. Are they even encoded? In the<br>
WP-2, for example, they are two bytes, one that has the ascii code and<br>
the other has bits set for various shift and function keys.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fixed width fonts aren't hard to make in any event. Better to use<br>
something without the Cidco copyright on it.<br>
<br>
At the momemnt cursor doesn't work all that well on WP-2, but I can get<br>
along ok without it. Will add one soon, just not my top priority.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like a new version :-) That's one of the reasons I've been poking<br>
around with WP-2 instead of MS, I know you said there are some bugs in<br>
the released code.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good point on the editor... then WP-2 is a word processor in ROM so I<br>
get an editor for free. On the MS, once we get Forth loaded there are<br>
lots of block editors around, and I believe there are also full screen<br>
editors. I've seen at least one complete forth word processor source<br>
code, we could use that if can't find something smaller.<br>
<br>
In any event we could just redirect I/O to the parallel port and<br>
interact completely over a terminal session. Then to upload code just<br>
use the terminal program. Then we could bootstrap our way to a<br>
filesystem.<br>

When I said that last Saturday, I thought it was ready...<br>
Then, before uploading, I thought I might actually test<br>
it!  The new flash code was working "pretty good", but<br>
when flashing large blocks, it would sometimes get a<br>
timeout error.  This was quite puzzling, because until then,<br>
the laplink code had been working flawlessly.<br>
<br>
It took me quite a while to figure out just *what* was happening,<br>
and then even longer to understand *why*.  I'm pretty sure I<br>
have it fixed now.  I will do some more testing tonight,<br>
and if all goes well, I'll upload it.<br>
<br>
(This is just a fix to ver 0.0.2, not the "next version", so<br>
it is still just for the older models.)<br>

"load", "save" and "verify" should all work properly now.  They<br>
each had the same problem with address calculations.  (Apparently,<br>
when I modified them to use 32 bit address, I didn't really test<br>
the change.)  Load only loads into RAM, but save should be able to<br>
save the protected pages of the codeflash to disk.<br>
<br>
Codeflash erase and write ("erase" & "zap") are working fine<br>
now, too.  Writing codeflash is quite a bit slower now, due<br>
to the fact that flash algorithm runs on the PC now, not on<br>
the mailstation.  It takes 35 seconds to flash a 16k page,<br>
versus 4.2 seconds with older method.  I have another method<br>
in mind that would be much faster. (maybe in future revision???)<br>
<br>
After I figured out what was wrong with old method (using code<br>
in same rom you are writing is not allowed), I was gonna add<br>
flash erase and flash write commands into mbug.  Then I realized<br>
that the flash algorithm could be implemented on either side of<br>
the laplink cable.  So I moved it over to the mailbug side.  It<br>
is slower now, because the flash commands have to be sent to the<br>
codeflash for each byte over the laplink.<br>
<br>
Most (all???) of the commands now can be cancelled with esc key.<br>
<br>
Several minor changes, that I can't think of right now.<br>
<br>
There is a new .zip file with (hopefully) all the files<br>
you need.  You need at a minimum the new mailbug.exe, and<br>
the matching mbug.rom.  They should work fine with the old<br>
mboot.rom if you already flashed it.  You should be able to<br>
unzip it on top of the old files.  I added scancode.hex, and<br>
a newer version of hello.rom.  The "crunch.dat" file may be<br>
newer, too (not sure).  crunch.dat holds the type info for<br>
the disassembler.<br>
<br>
I started making up some instructions for how to use it,<br>
but I haven't got very far with it yet.  If anyone has<br>
questions, just ask.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, I added a "blank check" for codeflash, but forgot<br>
to add it to the menu.  It's ctrl-b and it will prompt for<br>
which pages to check.<br>

Of course it can, but besides being slow as you've found, it is probably<br>
not the safest way to do it. If the connection breaks during burn (more<br>
likely since it takes longer) you could end up, say, with a<br>
half-programmed boot block.  Or is this code intended only for burning<br>
outside of the boot block?<br>
<br>
Probably the best thing would be to a) download a checksummed chunk of<br>
manageable size b) checksum it c) if it matches, burn it in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually flash block burns should probably not be interruptible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can it be used to update existing mbug.rom?<br>

The old brown non ergonomic case models,<br>
firmware ver 2.22r, 2.53yr, 2.54.<br>
These old models before the mailstation/mivo 100<br>
did not have a "number".  Possibly some of the<br>
mailstation/mivo 100 with firmware 3.xx???<br>
I think John H. flashed one of those and it<br>
worked.<br>

<br>
I expect that sooner or later, all up to 250.<br>
They are all quite similar.<br>

350.  It has different cpu (not z80).<br>
AFAIK, nobody is working on it.<br>

That is a very good point, that I had not considered.<br>
<br>
The first reason I thought of for doing it this way was to remove<br>
the possibility of accidently erasing/flashing, which was a problem<br>
in the past.  :-)<br>
<br>
The second reason was that it was way easier to code it in Pascal<br>
than z80 assembler!  ;^)<br>
<br>
<br>
Right up until the last moment, I had locked out the ability to erase<br>
the boot blocks.  I wanted to add a special function that would<br>
erase and reflash the boot code all in one operation.  But I<br>
compromised<br>
in the spirit of just getting it uploaded.  So now it issues a<br>
"stern warning" if you ask it to erase boot code.  You can only<br>
continue by typing "I dont't care" at the prompt.  :^O<br>
<br>
<br>
Sounds reasonable to me.  Maybe even send a whole 16k page, in<br>
the case of the boot block, and then let it burn it all at once.<br>
<br>
<br>
They're not, at least after you let it start.  But if you hit the<br>
key for, say, erase (or load, or save, etc.), when it is asking you<br>
*what* to erase (load, save ,etc.), you can just skip it.<br>
<br>
I do want to add the ability to abort some commands without<br>
finishing (for instance blank checking all 64 codeflash pages<br>
can get tiresome).  But reflashing of the boot block<br>
would definitely be one you would not want to be<br>
interruptable.<br>
<br>
<br>
(I know you mean mboot.rom, I can't keep them straight myself,<br>
and I named them!)<br>
<br>
Yes.  But you will have to answer the warning with<br>
"I don't care" (including the ' in don't) to erase the old<br>
mboot.rom, and then flash the new - _without_rebooting_mbug!<br>
<br>
But the neat thing about it is you should seldom need to<br>
reflash a new mboot.rom.  That is why it is seperated into<br>
mbug and mboot.  Mbug is a file on the PC disk, that gets<br>
loaded over the laplink to mailstation RAM.  It is what<br>
the debugger (mailbug) uses to interface to mailstation.<br>
<br>
It is a trivial matter to make change to mbug, reassemble,<br>
and test.  If you made a mistake, no problem, it's just<br>
in RAM.  Edit, assemble, and try again.<br>
<br>
Mboot is the part that is flashed into mailstation.<br>
It's only job is to run when mailstation reboots,<br>
and load the current mbug into ram.<br>
<br>
We need a better mboot.rom for the 120/150 etc.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I want to split the code that runs on<br>
the mailstation into three parts:<br>
1) Seldom changing boot code (mboot.rom), either loads mbug,<br>
or executes rom monitor if not connected to PC (mailbug).<br>
2) Changeable-without-fear-of-hosing rom-monitor, that<br>
runs automatically when not connected to mailbug.<br>
3) Latest greatest interface to debugger (mbug.rom, but<br>
it is not really burned to rom)<br>
<br>
If this doesn't make any sense, it is probably due to the fact<br>
that I have been up since yesterday.  I really need to<br>
sleep now...<br>
