As a programmer the typical policy is not do any patent searches.<br>
<br>
a) I don't know much about patents anyway -- which ones will hold up in<br>
court and which won't? Just about all tech patents are granted after<br>
enough changes. It doesn't mean that the patent isn't invalid for<br>
various reasons (prior art, etc.)<br>
b) I can't afford to pay a real lawyer to do a search for every idea I<br>
think of implementing<br>
c) If I was sued for infringement and the plaintiff won, and I knowingly<br>
infringed the patent, I would be liable for triple damages.<br>
<br>
As far as legal issues here, you are more likely to run afoul of the<br>
DMCA for trafficking in an illegal circumvention device for producing<br>
code that breaks the encryption.<br>
<br>
So if you are planning on going that route, you are clearly into<br>
violation of law which is a whole other matter than patent infringement.<br>
<br>
On copyright issues, which CJ brought up: whether a (C) notice appears<br>
in firmware doesn't really matter. I'd warrant most binary software does<br>
not embed a (C) string anywhere.<br>
<br>
According to the Berne Convention, as soon as a work is fixed in a<br>
tangible medium it is automatically protected by copyright. The only<br>
thing that gives you a right to make copies/ redistribute it is a<br>
license. None of us have such a license.<br>

Your points about the DMCA, patents, and copyrights are well taken. I<br>
hadn't even thought about the DMCA.<br>
<br>
The security key I mentioned in my earlier message might prevent any<br>
change to the machine no matter how it's introduced. I hope it<br>
doesn't affect the parallel port, because that seems to be the only<br>
viable method for changing the flash without using cryptography. I'm<br>
afraid, though, that any software modification could potentially<br>
violate the law.<br>
<br>
I hope I'm not heading toward a legal brick wall by trying to add<br>
functionality to the Mailstation. It would be a shame to let such a<br>
portable machine languish on just email.<br>

There is lots of software around that is in violation of the DMCA but is<br>
still widely used, such as DeCSS used by Linux users to view DVDs.<br>
<br>
The trick is the original code was developed by someone Jon Johansson in<br>
the Netherlands, and you generally have to download the code from non-us<br>
servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe there is a DMCA exemption for legitimate security research, if<br>
that helps you.<br>
<br>
In any event, there is no encryption key issue on the unit CJ has been<br>
working with via the parallel port.<br>
<br>
The encryption is there (quite rightly) to protect your mailstation from<br>
being attacked from the Internet. It is not intended to prevent<br>
reflashing the unit. Anyway, CJ has already succeeded in altering his<br>
firmware via the parallel link so we have a proof-of-concept right<br>
there.<br>
<br>
The DMCA doesn't tell you what you can do with your own hardware. It<br>
covers trafficking in circumvention devices. So if you author and<br>
distribute a circumvention device then you are in violation of the DMCA.<br>
If you created it but didn't distribute it, or you gave your unit to<br>
someone else and they unlocked it for you, for example would not be a<br>
DMCA problem.<br>
<br>
Of course, IANAL, so take all this with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
I personally hate the DMCA, software and business method patents,<br>
virtually perpetual copyrights, and the abandonware problems our<br>
copyright system creates. They are severe and intolerable limits on<br>
Freedom.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately freedom in the software and media realm isn't taken to be<br>
an important issue by the average citizen, so the law is going to stay<br>
screwed up for a long time, I think.<br>

Sorry! In fact I do know the difference. Somehow my fingers got ahead of<br>

Thanks for the correction.<br>
