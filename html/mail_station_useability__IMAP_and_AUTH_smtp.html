<p class="formattedBody">Hello, group, this is my first post here, as I recently got a blue<br>
det2 MS120 with 4.04e, which I was able to update the dialup and email<br>
acccount into on thanks to users posts, not just here.  At any rate,<br>
the useability of this machine is greatly reduced by the limitation of<br>
pop3 and non auth smtp mailing.  I, for one, would love to see the<br>
firmware updated to include these options, opening up other email<br>
services such as those from the likes of AOL itself.  (for my<br>
grandmother)<br>
The imap would not have to be complex, but just retrieve email form<br>
one folder, the 'inbox', thus simplifying the programming.  Also,<br>
'auth' could not be that hard?<br>
For those of you asking the question 'how can we set up an auth smtp<br>
relay without being taken advantage of spammers - here is how my<br>
school does it:  They keep a record of recent (authenticated) pop3<br>
logins and IPs, and only allow smtp mail from those.  Mial programs<br>
usually check pop incoming mail first, and then the server would know<br>
that it's OK to accept smtp session from that IP.  Jut a thought if<br>
you're serious about setting up a server for users of the mailstation.<br>
Thanks to all for your great work on this unit, although from what I<br>
see there is only a very basic debug shell and rom dump written in<br>
assembly so far.  Where are all the z80 games that run on the ti-85<br>
calculators? (that also use a z80 and pixel screen)  aah well.<br>
If we could just get smtp auth and simple imap protocol in these<br>
units it would be fantastic.  Best of luck, and let me know if you do<br>
so<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Do you think it would work just to set up a proxy server somewhere on<br>
the Internet? There was a discussion about this, and the idea was that<br>
you can use any ISP you like, we just need a proxy server somewhere that<br>
doesn't demand SMTP auth.<br>
<br>
I guess your POP3-auth-first would work.<br>
<br>
Why do we we need IMAP instead of POP3? Anyway if we're proxying it<br>
anyway the IMAP could be supported on the other side of the proxy.<br>

Well, IMAP can do a few things server-side that seem like they'd be<br>
pretty painful on an appliance like the Mailstation. Plus you could<br>
handle considerably more messages if you kept everything server-side<br>
and just cached a handfull of them locally.<br>
<br>
That said, I rather doubt the existing firmware is extensible enough<br>
that you can add support for arbitrary protocols to it. There has been<br>
some discussion of porting CP/M to the Mailstation, though. Are there<br>
any IMAP-capable email clients for that?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">OK, so the goal was to allow my grandparents to use their mailstation<br>
120 at their vacation cottage to send and receive email using their<br>
pre-existing AOL account, with no extra charge.<br>
<br>
It has been accomplished.<br>
<br>
What I did was allowed them to use a dial-up account that came with<br>
my DSL (so it was free)  and using my DSL I set up a server that<br>
receives their pop and smtp requests, translates pop to imap, adds an<br>
AUTH wrapper to their smtp request, and re-routes them to and from AOL.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the simplest of things, but it was a fun challenge.  The<br>
smtp translator was locked down to only allow requests from their<br>
dialup IP range, and email will only be sent if it matches their user<br>
account, so the likelihood of becoming an open relay is practically nil.<br>

Cool!<br>
<br>
Are you planning to make the script code available? Maybe there's a way<br>
to make it more generic so that one or a few of us could setup proxy<br>
servers for other users to connect to (without creating an open relay).<br>

<p class="formattedBody">well, the first sending software I could find is smtp server pro. This<br>
is not complex enough to send emails to different smtp servers based<br>
on sender's address.  However, the mdaemon sales rep said that mdaemon<br>
pro would be capable of doing this, so if you want to set up a group<br>
server, that might be your best bet.  For the pop software, I modified<br>
this:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kohsuke.org/imap2pop/">(URL)</a><br>
because this is open source, it could easily be modified to accept<br>
multiple users.  Note, however, that you have to change its method of<br>
getting the imap server address, because the mailstation uses the<br>
BEGINNING of the from address for pop authentication, and for most<br>
servers the from: address must match the smtp login name.<br>
