<p class="date">Mar 29, 2005</p>
<p class="formattedBody">Is it possible to both change to a different ISP, and ALSO to retain<br>
the Yahoo! service, which was set up through Earthlink?<br>
<br>
I am guessing I should follow the instructions from a prior<br>
post...(below)...can anyone confirm if this is the right sequence for<br>
the DET-1? The below instructions were for an "original black model"<br>
<br>
If I dump the system data, how do I set up the Yahoo! service?<br>
<br>
Thanks, sorry for the dumb questions, I'm not much of a techie.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">You must have a newer unit then. I have a Yahoo one and I can set up any ISP<br>
and 5 users.<br>

Here are some notes on some models:-<br>
<br>
FN+Shift+T or FN+Shift+Size are for MailStation 100<br>
<br>
===================================================<br>
If you press Function + d (on the MS 150, V4.04D) and press the<br>
hard reset button (with a paper clip) you'll get a slightly different<br>
menu dialog (the "Reset System Data" menu) after the memory scan? You<br>
have to keep holding Function + d after the reboot to see it.<br>
The menu shows an additional item: "Restore Default Account".<br>
<br>
===================================================<br>
I figured out how to get into the setup menu on my Mailstation 350.<br>
<br>
Remove the batteries and use only the ac adapter to power the unit.<br>
<br>
Perform a reset to factory default settings by pressing and holding<br>
down the keys &lt;Function + D> and power up. Select Yes when asked to<br>
restore to factory settings.<br>
<br>
During the message "Please wait while system resets" unplug the ac<br>
adapter. This corrupts the settings in memory so that the unit will<br>
now only bring up the setup menu.<br>
<br>
The setup menu asks for User Name, Dial Up Number, Reply to address,<br>
and E-mail address. There is also a Network settings button that<br>
appears in the menu. Unfortunatly it will not let you put in an e-<br>
mail address or allow you to go to the Network menu. I'm guessing<br>
there is some combination of keystrokes or some hidden way to allow<br>
access to those settings but I haven't been able to figure it out.<br>
<br>
===================================================<br>
Good work Jeff. I could perform the reset with batteries as well.<br>
All I did was to to use a pin inserted on the little hole on the<br>
back to press the reset button during the message "Please wait<br>
while system resets". Then, press Fnct-D keys during the next<br>
power on.<br>
<br>
===================================================<br>
A Mivo 250 uses Fcn-Shift-SIZE!!! Not T!!!<br>
<br>
===================================================<br>
Great news! I was able to configure a Mailstation (black) original model to<br>
work with Access-4-Free, a free (10hrs month) ISP!<br>
