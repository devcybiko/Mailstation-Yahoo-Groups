<p class="formattedBody">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I'm hoping someone can help me.  I got a Mailstation recently=<br>
for my<br>
mentally-handicapped brother, but Earthlink won't set up a new mai=<br>
lbox<br>
for it.  I learned how to get in to change the email provider's addre=<br>
ss<br>
from Earthlink, so I got a Bluebottle account, but the Mailstation<br>
can=<br>
't receive it.  I'm guessing it's something to do with the anti-spam<br>
proto=<br>
cols, but I'm not a programmer and I don't know what to do next.<br>
Can anyo=<br>

Thanks in advance,<br>

You need a local dial up number with a r=<br>

won't do webmail. Where are you?<br>

-Oh, believe me, it's true!!!<br>
<br>
I don't think there has been any acknowledgment of mailstation<br>

<br>
It is possible you won't be able to send any mail (if they<br>
are using the "smtp auth" protocol (??? I think that is what<br>
it is called). But you should be able to pop your incoming mail.<br>
-That's what I thought, but the Mailstation couldn't access the bluebottle site.  Maybe it tries to send first?<br>
<br>
I checked www.bluebottle. com, but I could not tell if they<br>
require the "auth" protocol. A lot of isp's do require it<br>
these days.<br>
-I know.<br>

on their homepage is dated August 2007!!! Are they still<br>
in business??? :-)<br>
-They are; I sent them a question yesterday and got an answer the same day.  (It wasn't helpful, but it was an answer. . . )  I was looking specifically for POP email accounts, so I know it does allow access.<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed that the smtp server is listed as down,<br>
since Sunday. Maybe that's your only problem???<br>
(The service status is at bottom of the help page.)<br>
-Thanks for letting me know; but I was testing the Mailstation on Friday, so that shouldn't have been the issue.<br>
<br>
Both the pop3 and smtp servers are named mail.bluebottle. com ,<br>
did you set them? Did you set a valid DNS server address?<br>
-I definitely set the servers, and I set them correctly because I tested the same settings on my computer using Outlook Express.  I don't think I  set the DNS because I don't know where to find that address.<br>
<br>
If you post the settings you are using, someone might<br>
have better suggestions to try.<br>
-Thanks, I'll do that.  I don't have them with me right now but I'll post them tonight.<br>
