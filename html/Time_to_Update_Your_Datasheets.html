.<br>
<br>
For those who are impatient and want to know what I found, how does "s=<br>
chematic diagram" sound?<br>
<br>
It's detailed documents of two versions of the Ma=<br>
ilstation 250 and one of the Mailstation 350.  Not only are there photos of=<br>
the hardware, but also photos of the circuit boards, and then the best par=<br>
t, full schematics.  And oh yes they are full.  For example, I now know tha=<br>
t the CPU crystal is 12.288mhz.  And, even better, I know the labels of eve=<br>
ry CPU pin, including the unused ones.<br>
<br>
From there, I can see that it can a=<br>
ddress up to 8MB of memory.  I can see that it has TX/RX serial pins.  I ca=<br>
n see that it does indeed have an additional unused device selector.  I can=<br>
see what is very likely an oscillator out pin, which could possibly be use=<br>
d to determine the frequency currently used by the CPU after going through =<br>
the divider.  I can see that it has a whole 'nother unused 8-bit port.  Man=<br>
y of the pin labels I simply don't know the purpose of at the moment, so wh=<br>
o knows what else is in there.<br>
<br>
And for the record, the 350 runs at 34.4mhz=<br>
.<br>
<br>
So, why only the 250 and 350?  Good question.  I'll start at the beginni=<br>
ng of my search and go from there in explaining what I learned.<br>
<br>
First, I w=<br>
ent in search of the FCC number on the back of my Mailstation: 1EBCHN-27372=<br>
-OT-E.  Turns out, this wasn't a normal FCC ID.  I didn't understand why it=<br>
was different from what they wanted.  But regardless, I got nothing, so th=<br>
at was a dead-end.  So, by happenstance I dropped it into Google before giv=<br>
ing up, and found some results.  Nothing big, it looked like just some FCC =<br>
update notices of some kind.  Stuff that looks like this:<br>
<br>
648-CX-2001     =<br>
8145386-5<br>
NOTICE OF CHANGE NOT AFFECTING COMPLIANCE<br>
HAS BEEN FILE=<br>

REG. NO.: 1EBCHN-27372-OT-E<br>
GRANTEE: =<br>
INVENTEC ELECTRONICS (NANJING) CO.,LTD.<br>
NATURE OF APPLICATION:<br>
EQUIPMENT=<br>
DESCRIPTION: E-MAIL TERMINAL MODEM DEVICE W/FAX WITH CALLER ID<br>
TRADE NAME=<br>
: CIDCO<br>
MODEL: FB DET1, DET1A, DET1B, DET2<br>
<br>
I noticed the grantee name,=<br>
"Inventec Electronics."  So, back to the FCC database with that.  Many res=<br>
ults!  But I started going through'em anyway, clicking Details, then one of=<br>
their external photos, just to see what it was.  Didn't take long, but the=<br>
next thing I knew I was staring at the picture of a Mailstation, and I cou=<br>
ldn't believe the other files I found in there with it.  Short of a datashe=<br>
et for the CPU, a schematic of the whole thing is the next best thing you c=<br>
ould have.<br>
<br>
So, curious of what else Mailstation-related I might find burie=<br>
d away in there (like perhaps the older models), I searched just for grante=<br>
es with that name, which you can do there on the left if you do an advanced=<br>
search.  I got multiple results for Inventec Electronics.  One of them was=<br>
listed as "Nanjing" though, which is in that text I pasted above that I fo=<br>
und on Google.  It has the grantee code "PQU".  And sure enough, putting ju=<br>
st that one into the search gives you only the Mailstation results.  Just t=<br>
he three, though, unfortuantely.<br>
<br>
Eventually I found that the number on the=<br>
back of my Mailstation isn't an FCC ID.  It's an FCC Registration Number, =<br>
which is different.  The older Mailstation is classified under "Part 68" eq=<br>
uipment, which apparently means it doesn't need extensive testing, since it=<br>
's just a telephone network device.  However..!  The Mailstation 250 and up=<br>
use wireless base stations to connect to their phone line.  This means the=<br>
y're using frequency spectrum, which means they require a full-on FCC ID.  =<br>
I probably could have saved myself a few steps if I owned a 250 or 350 and =<br>
had their FCC ID to begin with.  But hey, whatever works.<br>
<br>
In any case, t=<br>
here is one interesting thing of note about the FCC registration number.  T=<br>
he first three characters, 1EB, are this in their database:<br>
<br>
1EB|INVENTEC E=<br>

INALD TIBBETTS|2151 CAMINO PABLO|MORAGA|CA|94556|<br>
<br>
So, as it turns out, Inv=<br>
entec is definitely who developed the Mailstation.  Their name is on all of=<br>
the schematics as well.  And a Google search shows their name in Cidco pre=<br>
ss releases/financial reports/whatever.<br>
<br>
But here's the really interesting =<br>
part: Inventec made a CPU for one of the TI calculators too, apparently.  A=<br>
nyone who knows anything about those graphing calculators know that they us=<br>
ed Z80 CPUs for years.  I found this in a Google search, of a guy asking fo=<br>
r information on a chip:<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm in search of data for an Inventec =<br>
processor. The chip came from a TI-83+ graphing calculator as bares the tex=<br>

<br>
...if it helps, this i=<br>
s a Z80-enabled CISC processor. I've tried googling and came up empty. Any =<br>
data on pinouts, or clocking data would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice =<br>
the similarity of the part number!  The Mailstation's is 3SI176 0A.  A Goog=<br>
le search on the 6SI one gives some results, but I found that I get other r=<br>
esults when I put in "6S1837".  Somebody seems to have mistaken an I for a =<br>
1.<br>
<br>
So, I emailed Inventec, and I guess we'll see if my email ever gets bey=<br>
ond the webmaster to anywhere that might possibly have information on the M=<br>
ailstation CPU.<br>
<br>
p.s.  For anyone interested, here's the somewhat vague =<br>
at times patent application for what I'm almost certain is the Mailstation.=<br>

I'm thinking BZCLK might be a buzzer?  The 350 has a buzzer connec=<br>

Looks like there's an =<br>

so it's surely one of those.<br>
<br>
All I've ever really known about the 350's g=<br>
