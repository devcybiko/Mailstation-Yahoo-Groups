<p class="formattedBody">Since the topic of clock speed came up a few days ago, I<br>
have been wonderin=<br>
g about it myself.  I never was very<br>
happy with the idea that the cpu was r=<br>
unning at 8, 10, or<br>
12 MHz, because (for one reason) I did not see any poin=<br>
t<br>
to it.  IOW, if the cpu can run at 12 MHz, why not run<br>
it at 12 MHz?<br>
<br>
A=<br>
t first I thought the lower speed might be for the sake of<br>
power-dissipati=<br>
on.  (Assuming it is a CMOS<br>
cpu, since power dissipation in CMOS is essent=<br>
ially directly<br>
proportional to clock speed).<br>
<br>
But, since cpu goes to sleep=<br>
when there is nothing to do,<br>
and it would be awake for shorter periods at =<br>
12 MHz,<br>
the power dissipation would be essentially the same at<br>
any of the 3=<br>
speeds.<br>
<br>
Another reason I was uncomfortable with 8/10/12 speeds<br>
is that AF=<br>
AIK it is quite difficult to divide by 1.2<br>
or 1.5, as opposed to dividing b=<br>
y an integer.<br>
<br>
But there is one really good reason to run a cpu<br>
slower:  m=<br>
emory access time!<br>
<br>
But if that is the reason, rather than slow the<br>
whole =<br>
cpu down, it makes A LOT more sense to slow<br>
just the memory-access cycles =<br>
with wait-states.<br>
<br>
So, perhaps port 0x0d is just setting the<br>
number of wai=<br>
t states?<br>
<br>
I have not researched this idea very far, but<br>
perhaps the appare=<br>
nt speeds of "10 & 8 MHz"<br>
are accomplished as "1 or 2 wait-states"?<br>
<br>
This s=<br>
eems much more plausible than dividing<br>
the actual clock by non-integer amou=<br>
nt.<br>
<br>
It is also possible that they allow setting<br>
different wait-states for =<br>
various devices<br>
(codeflash, dataflash, RAM, LCD, modem).<br>
