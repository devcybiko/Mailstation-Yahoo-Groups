<p class="formattedBody">Hi.<br>
I have 3 mailstations I collected in the past 3 years or so. Each of<br>
the 3 DET1's has a firmware version which allows me to put in ISP<br>
settings, POP3 server, smtp server, passwords, etc. I was going to<br>
distribute some to my relatives so we could email easily, but a<br>
problem came up.<br>
<br>
Up until about 15 months ago I had been using one of them with my<br>
AT&T email account. But suddenly it stopped working. After much<br>
investigation and NO HELP FROM AT&T, I determined that it was the<br>
XTND command coming from the Mailstation which was causing an error<br>
message on the mailserver which basically killed the whole process.<br>
<br>
I've tried to find other free email services which can tolerate the<br>
XTND command by either ignoring it or coming back with OK but not an<br>
error message. But I have been unable to find an email service which<br>
will work.<br>
<br>
Does anyone in the group have the name and/or address of an email<br>
provider I can use which WILL work with my mailstation ?<br>
<br>
Has anyone figured out how to hack the code to avoid this issue ?<br>
<br>
BTW, I'd be willing to sell at least two of them if someone is<br>
interested. They are LIKE "NEW".<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
Mark<br>
