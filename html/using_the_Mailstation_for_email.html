Essentially, what you need is a full decode of the program that is in the<br>
mailstation !!<br>
<br>
The place to start, is the US patent office, and look at the patent's that<br>
are on the unit.<br>
After reading one of them it gives you an idea of how the unit works, and<br>
what format it<br>
uses to do that with.<br>
<br>
But what is needed is for somebody that understands the program language or<br>
code that<br>
it is programmed in to dump it out on paper, and then it can be<br>
re-constructed to do what is<br>
needed.<br>
<br>
I used to work with the Z80 code, way back in my life time. Now I think they<br>
have a computer<br>
program that will take the data and print the programming out for you.  On<br>
the newer units,<br>
I am not sure what computer code they are using ??<br>
<br>
We still have not really figured out how the parallel port programs the unit<br>
on all versions<br>
at this point. That is needed to fully allow anything to happen.<br>
<br>
I would like to find who the manufacturer of the unit is ??  Somebody built<br>
these, and it<br>
wasn't Earthlink ???  It would even be nice to be able to have a unit<br>
re-programmed to the<br>
original programming, or get a unit repaired.  Earthlink cannot repair these<br>
units nor direct you<br>
to anybody that can !!!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there are some people who do know these units but can only<br>
talk about them<br>
so much because they are still being used by Earthlink, and those people<br>
have contracts with<br>
Earthlink to provide services for these units.<br>
<br>
If Earthlink ever decides to drop the units, and no longer allow them on<br>
their system, then maybe<br>
these people would be able to talk about the units and their programming<br>
more. But until that happens,<br>
I can understand why they would be reluctant to come forward and discuss<br>
anything.<br>
<br>
Although, it would be helpful to get some direction on getting bad units<br>
repaired or reprogrammed so<br>
they could at least go back in service on Earthlink !!!!<br>
<br>
As far as the units using XNTD signaling ??   I would assume that the unit<br>
could be reprogrammed to<br>
eliminate that signal.  If you have an Email server you have control over,<br>
you could probably change the<br>
"Sendmail" or "Procmail" program on it to ignore or use the XNTD signal.<br>
But that is not the only<br>
item that this mail program does. It uses an MD5 encryption code for the<br>
unit.  That code has to be<br>
sent correctly for the unit to program and possibly work correctly.  It can<br>
only be sent in a MIME format,<br>
which leaves out most of the mail formats from sending it.<br>
<br>
What I am really surprised is, that NOBODY else has come out and built a<br>
mail machine to do something<br>
similar ?? You would think AOL or somebody else would do that ??  I know<br>
there is a use for the machines,<br>
I have 2 units out there at my relatives.  They are not that computer<br>
literate, but they can use the mail units<br>
easily, and now they can't live without them. So somebody could build a unit<br>
that would work on any POP3<br>
system and easily sell it !!!!  All you need is a couple of 800 telephone<br>
trunks, and an Email/DNS Server<br>
unit, and you are in business.  Just steer clear of the "Mailstation"<br>
patent.  I don't think POP3 has a patent,<br>
but the "mailstation" unit does, so you would have to make a unit that was<br>
designed strictly for POP3,<br>
and was an open architecture, with none of the special MD5 keys and such<br>
that the mailstation was using.<br>
<br>
Good luck !!!<br>

<p class="formattedBody">The mailstations were originally sold under the brand<br>
name Cidco. The processor is not actually a z80, but a<br>
z80 compatible microcontroller with several<br>
enhancements, including several on-chip serial and<br>
parallel ports. The cpu appears to be a either a house<br>
numbered and or discontinued variant of a Rabbit<br>
Semiconductors 2000. Rabbit Semiconductor does not<br>
list the processor, but it is similar to the chips<br>
used in some of the TI programmable calculators.<br>
Somewhere on this board is a complete memory dump of<br>
one of the models.<br>

You said "The cp=<br>

<br>
Can you tell us why it appears that way???<br>
=<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, I often am, but here is why I<br>
think it is *NOT* a Rabbit=<br>
part:<br>
<br>
1) The pinout does not match any Rabbit part.  Not even close.<br>
A=<br>
re there any discontinued Rabbit parts?  I think the 2000 may have<br>
been =<br>
the first part they made.<br>
<br>
2) There appears to be no ROM or RAM built into<br>
=<br>
the 3SI176 (it has an address and data bus).  The mailstations<br>
codefl=<br>
ash, dataflash, and ram are all in external chips.<br>
So, It would not have=<br>
/need a way to program internal flash.<br>
<br>
3) If I remember correctly, the Rab=<br>
bit parts have extended<br>
opcodes that z80 does not have.  Mailstation cod=<br>
e<br>
appears to use just standard z80 opcodes.<br>
<br>
4) The rabbit bank-switchin=<br>
g seems quite a bit different than the<br>
mailstation's.  The mailstation =<br>
does bank-switching more like<br>
the MSX, Gameboy, and Avigo.<br>
<br>
It has been =<br>
a few years since I did my research on this<br>
subject, but that is what I re=<br>
member finding.<br>
<br>
<br>

I did find a listing for the part number on a chip<br>
broker site that listed the mfr as rabbit<br>
semiconductor. At the time, It was apparently produced<br>
at an asian factory under contract to rabbit. From<br>
what I can tell, Rabbit was bought out by a larger<br>
company, who made it a subsidary. They seemed to<br>
reorganize and dropped the old lines the came out with<br>
the much enhance series that included the 2000. My<br>
guess is it had to do with intellectual property<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are most likely correct. However, even Zilog<br>
extended the original Z80 opcodes with later chips. It<br>
may be likely that the TI inventec chip and the 3SI176<br>
are "first cousins" so to speak.<br>
I metasearched the part and found several chinese chip<br>
brokers have them available, and some may have<br>
datasheets. Unfortunately, I don't know chinese.<br>
<br>
So are you familiar with the Z80 chipe in the TI calc?<br>
