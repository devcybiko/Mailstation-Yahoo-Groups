<p class="formattedBody">So while we have some very detailed info on many of the Mailstation<br>
ports,=<br>
there's still a lot we don't know.  So I decided to just poke<br>
around, and=<br>
found a bit of stuff that was interesting, and some not<br>
so much, but coul=<br>
d lead to more later.  HERE GOES:<br>
<br>
These three ports were assumed to contr=<br>
ol the RTC, but I'm thinking<br>
they control a hardware timer.<br>
<br>
Port #1d<br>
- S=<br>
etting bit 2 triggers interrupt 5 (not sure why yet)<br>
- Setting port to #FF=<br>
only reads back as #0F<br>
<br>
Port #1e<br>
- Set to #FF returns 0<br>
<br>
Port #1f<br>
- Sett=<br>
ing bit 1 freezes Mailstation (endless interrupt?)<br>
<br>
After finding out that =<br>
I could make very high-speed interrupt 5's<br>
happen by fiddling around with =<br>
#1d and #1f, I looked in the<br>
Mailstation code, and they used some similar =<br>
code to what I was doing<br>
to make it happen:<br>
<br>
xor	a<br>
set	2, a<br>
out	(#1d), a<br>
=<br>
ld	a, #0e<br>
out	(#1f), a<br>
ld	a, #0c<br>
out	(#1f), a<br>
<br>
With this, interrupt 5 hap=<br>
pens repeatedly, and much faster than the<br>
keyboard interrupt (which happen=<br>
s 64 times a second), but I couldn't<br>
measure it because time16 apparently =<br>
stops working when this is in<br>
progress.  I tried to measure it inside the =<br>
keyboard interrupt, but<br>
it seemed to fluctuate so much that I couldn't get=<br>
a result.  I'm not<br>
sure if that's due to the interrupt itself fluctuating=<br>
, or perhaps<br>
the cpu not being able to keep up to get a proper measurement=<br>
.<br>
<br>
However, I think that you're supposed to set an interval for this<br>
someh=<br>
ow.  Maybe there's a bit somewhere that possibly makes P10-P1C<br>
set timer l=<br>
ength instead of RTC?<br>
<br>
Port #0b<br>
- Clearing bit 3 distorts the lcd in var=<br>
ious ways, and makes it seem<br>
to draw certain columns in different places t=<br>
han usual.  Bits 0-2<br>
seem to affect how it does this.  I have no idea what=<br>
this is doing<br>
at the moment, but it makes the LCD pretty much unusable.<br>
=<br>
- Clearing bit 7 turns off LCD<br>
<br>
Port #0d (CPU clock rate control)<br>
- Setti=<br>
ng bits 0-2 makes it run noticably slow.  Variations seem to<br>
make it simil=<br>
arly slow.  I'm positive that this is slower than 8mhz.<br>
Could be 4, or ev=<br>
en less.  I'd have to come up with some sort of test.<br>
<br>
Port #2f<br>
- Setting=<br>
bit 2 makes odd speaker noise + LED flicker (I thought I<br>
clocked somethin=<br>
g too high and burned up a chip or something at<br>
first!)<br>
- Setting bits 4,=<br>
6 makes time16 interrupt 2x slower (kbdmax =3D 128)<br>
- Setting bits 5,6 mak=<br>
es time16 interrupt 4x slower (kbdmax =3D 256)<br>
- Setting bits 4,5,6 makes =<br>
time16 interrupt 8x slower (kbdmax =3D 512)<br>
- When bit 6 is clear, but 4, =<br>
5, or both are set, time16 interrupt<br>
doesn't seem to ever occur.<br>
<br>
kbdmax i=<br>
s the variable I used before to detect how many times<br>
interrupt 1 (keyboar=<br>
d handler) occurred in between time16's.<br>
Normally, kbdmax has a value of =<br>
64 when a time16 interrupt occurs,<br>
just for reference with the above.<br>
<br>
The=<br>
following info regarding port #2f was found in codeflash page 3,<br>
in a fun=<br>
ction at #4349:<br>
- Bits 6,7 are enabled by firmware when it sets the port<br>
=<br>
- Bits 0-2 are cleared by firmware when it sets the port<br>
- Bit 3 is passed=<br>
along from p2Fshadow<br>
<br>
So basically, 11xxc000, where xx bits controls how m=<br>
uch to slow down<br>
time16, while c is unknown to me.  I'm not even sure what=<br>
use this<br>
port is, since changing the cpu speed doesn't seem to affect the=<br>
<br>
interrupt speeds.<br>
<br>
Here's some slightly useless info for the moment, bu=<br>
t it shows that<br>
some of these are quite possibly used for something:<br>
<br>
Port=<br>
#0c<br>
- Setting #00 returns #05<br>
- setting #FF returns #E3<br>
<br>
Port #20<br>
- Set=<br>
ting #FF returns #40<br>
<br>
Port #29<br>
- Setting #FF returns #0F<br>
<br>
These seem enti=<br>
rely useless:<br>
<br>
Ports #04, #22-27, #2a, #2b, #2e<br>
- Setting #FF returns #00<br>
=<br>
<br>
And these seem to just not be connected to anything at all:<br>
<br>
#30 - #50<br>
-=<br>
returns value of port itself<br>
<br>
I stopped testing at #50, but I assume all t=<br>
he rest to #FF do the same<br>
<br>

I discovered what bits 0 and 1 are doing, a=<br>

<br>
When I disable bit 0, keys on keyboard row 8 stop responding.  No=<br>

course my determination of them not responding is whether the MS<br>

it's fl=<br>

<br>
When I disable bit 1, keyboard row 9 stops res=<br>

conclusive test would have to be done as to whethe=<br>
r it's entirely<br>
killing that keyboard row, but it certainly stops working =<br>
in my<br>
initial test.<br>
<br>
Bit 2 doesn't seem to have any effect on the keyboard=<br>
.<br>
<br>
Bit 3 still causes the screen to go wonky.<br>
<br>
Bit 7 still causes the LCD g=<br>
o off.<br>
<br>
Then I realized, where does this sound familiar?  Yep, port 2!  I<br>
=<br>
thought maybe this was just a mirror of that port.  Bits 0, 1, and 7<br>
certa=<br>
inly seem similar in function.  But no, when I tried to enable<br>
the LED via=<br>
bit 4, it didn't work.  I even tried a direct test with<br>
interrupts disabl=<br>
ed, in case it was flipping the bit around in the<br>
interrupt too fast to se=<br>
e if the light was on.  It never came on, no<br>
matter which way I set the bi=<br>
t.<br>
<br>
So I dunno really.  Reading back port 0x02 while FyOS is running<br>
shows=<br>
me 0xac, while reading back 0x0b gives 0xff.  Maybe they're not<br>
as relate=<br>
d as I thought.  But it certainly seems to have some similar-<br>
looking funct=<br>
ionality at this point.<br>
