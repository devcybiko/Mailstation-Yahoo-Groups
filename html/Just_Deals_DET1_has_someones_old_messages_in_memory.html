re several<br>
emails from/to a Kirstin who is apparently new to email ("I GOT =<br>

FOR MY PHONE!!"). Interesting to read. My guess is that the Just Deals=<br>
<br>
units were re-furbished from a warrenty return. They reset them at the<br>
fac=<br>

to read s=<br>

Indeed, it does raise privacy concerns.  Reliable and complete deletion<br>
of (possibly) sensitive information should definitely be on the list of<br>
any refurbishement operation...   My guess is that they just didn't<br>
give it any thought at the refurb place, just assumed the reset would<br>
do the trick.  With flash memory, though, that's not enough - I think<br>
there should have been a ROM routine included for doing just that.<br>

It's Shift-F5 (from test mode), to enter hex viewer mode.<br>

I find it both useful and interesting!  Useful, because it inspir=<br>
ed<br>
me to take another look at the file structure from the hex-viewer.<br>
I hav=<br>
e been trying to understand the file system by examining the<br>
code.  But the=<br>

<br>
And interesting, because it raises the question=<br>

<p class="formattedBody">I work a lot with used computers, and they often have<br>
old data on them. I will usually backup the data, and<br>
hold it until I can verify that the previous owner<br>
doen't want it, at which time I delete the backup.<br>
MOst of the time the former owner is unreachable or<br>
doesn't want the old data.<br>
