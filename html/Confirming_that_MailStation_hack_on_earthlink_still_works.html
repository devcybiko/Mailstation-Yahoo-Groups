<p class="formattedBody">Despite the claims by all the Indian tech support people at Earthlink, the =<br>
Mailstation still works if you're replacing a dead mailstation with a new o=<br>
ne using the same account. The arrogant Indians and their supervisors will =<br>
tell you it can't be done. That's because the Cidco email server has been t=<br>
aken down so they can't send the mailstation an message and set it up autom=<br>
atically. But it can be done manually...<br>
<br>
Let me clarify... Grandma age 90 =<br>
had a Mailstation DET1 which finally became inoperable...<br>
<br>
she had rubbed a=<br>
ll the letters off the keys...and had used it for 10 years talking to her c=<br>
hildren and grandchildren...<br>
<br>
We purchased a Mailstation 120 off ebay... di=<br>
d the paperclip holding down the function D and pulling the plug thing...<br>
<br>
=<br>
If you google "Is the Mailstation 150 hackable", you'll see the instruction=<br>
with a paperclip to get into the mailstation setup screens...<br>
<br>
From there=<br>
, you can set everything as long as you know the password<br>
for an existing a=<br>
ccount. Just change the ISPaccount to the one you're replacing. There is no=<br>
thing inside the machine that is hard coded...<br>
Yes it does require an exist=<br>
ing Earthlink account with a fixed DNS.<br>
<br>
We now have a new machine for Gran=<br>
dma. She's 90 now and doesn't have to learn how to type with her thumbs...<br>
=<br>
<br>
Hope this helps...<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Wow! Thanks for that info.  Mom's is still plugging along so far; she is 92=<br>
and terminal with end-stage renal disease, so I suspect the MailStation wi=<br>
ll outlast her (although she has been like the "Energizer Bunny" and fooled=<br>
everyone including her doctors for nine years now!).  But I have wondered,=<br>
"What will we do" if her machine goes out or if EL pulls the plug altogeth=<br>
er on its existing users.  It's nice to know there are options, doing a hac=<br>
k an a new machine being one.  Another, and I'm not sure if it's still vali=<br>
d since the post was from 2008, but Patrick Forbes on this board had lined =<br>
his mom out with a new, better and cheaper ISP for the service and made the=<br>
machine work with it.  You can read the appropriate post here:<br>
