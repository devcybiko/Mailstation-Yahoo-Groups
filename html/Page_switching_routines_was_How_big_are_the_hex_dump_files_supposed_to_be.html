<p class="formattedBody">Maybe you have analyzed the other differences since you posted this<br>
note, but I have noticed one important one: The code at 1952 executes<br>
completely in the alternate register set, which means that you can<br>
use it to pass parameters in the registers.<br>
<br>
That is, you could push the page number and program address on the<br>
stack and setup some registers and call 05ED. The registers will be<br>
preserved through the code at 1952 and will arrive at the called<br>
routine intact. Any return values are also preserved. This mechanism<br>
makes the presence of the page switching logic almost transparent.<br>
