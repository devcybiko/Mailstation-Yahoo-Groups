<p class="from">From: "ebjoew" &lt;jwatsjunk@...></p>
<p class="date">Mar 29, 2012</p>
<p class="formattedBody">Hello All,<br>
<br>
I am a new arrival. I acquired a MailStation 250 at an auction =<br>
for a grand total of $1. It did not include an AC adapter nor a base unit. =<br>
It is a model DET2B with V1.12 firmware in a silvery grey case. I opened it=<br>
up to find out what was inside and to consider hacking this gizmo.<br>
<br>
Since =<br>
I do not have a base unit that communicates by RF with the MailStation itse=<br>
lf, the first thing I did was remove the antenna and its connecting cable s=<br>
ince it was useless. I rather expect to be doing some hardware work inside =<br>
this thing and I felt removing the antenna and its cable from the board jus=<br>
t simplified things a little.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the details scattered around in th=<br>
e messages and files produced in past by this group, I have found out how t=<br>
o get into those extra menus which let one "Restore Default Account" and en=<br>
ter the Hex Viewer and Hex Editor. I also stumbled into what to do to cause=<br>
it to let me bring up the "Please create a new user account" prompt where =<br>
it lets me enter ALL the settings for a user account including the ISP Acco=<br>
unt, ISP Password, Primary DNS, etc., etc.<br>
<br>
While I have no wish to use the=<br>
MailStation for its usual email purpose, I have played with it enough and =<br>
read enough messages here to know that this might be useful info for somebo=<br>
dy else so I thought I should document it here for others. So here is how I=<br>
go about it.<br>
<br>
1. Be sure the unit has power, either via AC adapter or bat=<br>
teries.<br>
<br>
2. Start with the unit off.<br>
<br>
3. We will begin by removing any ol=<br>
d existing user account settings and setting the unit to the default user a=<br>
ccount. I have read in many places where all one has to do is hold down the=<br>
"Function" and "D" keys while pressing the reset button but I have found t=<br>
hat often does not work for me. Some experimenting has taught me that this =<br>
slight variation on that procedure makes it work reliably for me. I turn th=<br>
e unit on with the power button and let the unit come up into the main Mail=<br>
Station 250 menu. Then, with it still in that screen, I hold down the "Func=<br>
tion" and "D" keys and press the reset button and continue to hold down the=<br>
"Function" and "D" keys during a pause of several seconds, followed by a b=<br>
rief "Scanning memory data" progress bar, whereupon the unit presents the "=<br>
Reset System Data" menu. At this point the "Function" and "D" keys may be r=<br>
eleased. The "No Clear" menu item is highlighted. Press the down arrow key =<br>
once to move the highlight to the "Restore Default Account" menu item and t=<br>
hen press the "Enter" key to select it.<br>
<br>
4. The unit prompts with the ques=<br>
tion "Are you sure to clear?" and the answer "Yes" is highlighted. Press th=<br>
e "Enter" key. We end up in the main "MailStation 250" menu. Just below the=<br>
"MailStation 250" text at the top of the screen, we see that the unit's em=<br>
ail address now consists of the unit's serial number followed by "@mailstat=<br>
ion.com". If one selects "Extras" and then "Settings", we can see that the =<br>
user name has been set to "New Customer". In any case, press the power butt=<br>
on to turn the unit off.<br>
<br>
5. Next we simultaneously hold down the "Functio=<br>
n" key, the "Q" key, and the "A" key and momentarily press the power button=<br>
. We can release all the keys when we then get a prompt that consists only =<br>
of a wide empty rectangle in the middle of the screen.<br>
<br>
6. Type (without t=<br>
he quotes) "qa781206" and press the "Enter" key. We arrive at the "DIAGNOST=<br>
IC MAIN MENU" screen.<br>
<br>
7. Hold down either Shift key while you press the F=<br>
5 key. The F5 key is the rightmost unlabeled button located just below the =<br>
screen. You will arrive at the Hex Viewer screen. The Hex Viewer is not lab=<br>
elled as such. It just appears as a screen full of hexadecimal digits with =<br>
a wide column of alphanumeric and/or graphic characters on the right.<br>
<br>
The =<br>
first three pairs of digits at the start of each line is a memory address. =<br>
The first such address appearing on the top line of the screen will be 00 0=<br>
0 00 followed by a colon (:) and then the hexadecimal contents of each of t=<br>
he 16 bytes of memory starting at that address.  When I do this I see all z=<br>
eros for those 16 bytes. In fact, I see all zeros for the hexadecimal conte=<br>
nts all down this page.<br>
<br>
At this point you could use the arrow keys, the "P=<br>
g up" key, and the "Pg dn" key to move around in memory to see its contents=<br>
but we next need to change the contents of one particular memory cell.<br>
<br>
8=<br>
. In order to be able to change any cells we must enable the Hex Viewer to =<br>
enter its Hex Editor mode. That requires entering something of a special pa=<br>
sscode. To do that, type in the following string (without the quotes) "g710=<br>
304x" and then press the "Back" button. As soon as you press the "g" key, a=<br>
small box will appear to allow you to enter the rest of the string. Do not=<br>
worry that there is not enough room for the "x" at the end of the string i=<br>
n that box. In fact, you will not even see the "x" on the screen but it is =<br>
still important. When you press the "Back" button, the input box will simpl=<br>
y disappear and things will look the same as they were before you typed in =<br>
that special command.<br>
<br>
9. Type in this string (without the quotes) "g02290=<br>
0" and press the "Enter" key. While typing it in, the input box will again =<br>
appear momentarily to allow you to finish typing the command. When you pres=<br>
s the "Enter" key, the Hex Viewer will begin displaying the data for the me=<br>
mory cells beginning at address 022900. We can confirm this is where we are=<br>
in memory by reading that the start of the first line reads like this: 02 =<br>
29 00 : 01 00 4e 65 77 20 and so forth. If we look at the panel of alphanum=<br>
eric/graphic characters on the right side of the screen, we see that the fi=<br>
rst line contains the words "New Customer". Also, a few lines after that, w=<br>
e see the default email address consisting of the unit's serial number foll=<br>
owed by "@..." We can also note that the first digit (a zero) f=<br>
ollowing that colon on the first line of the screen is highlighted. Press t=<br>
he right arrow key one time to move the highlight to the very next characte=<br>
r which is a "1".<br>
<br>
10. I suspect that this "1" indicates that there is one =<br>
email account set up in the unit but that is just my best guess. In any cas=<br>
e, I find that for me this next step gets me to where I want to go. Press t=<br>
he "S" key. We see that the right part of the screen changes to indicate th=<br>
at we have entered the Hex Editor. It shows us that we could press Ctrl+S t=<br>
o Save & Exit, Back to Exit, Arrow to move the cursor, or 0-9,A-F for input=<br>
. We also see that the highlight is still on that "1". (By the way, althoug=<br>
h it says "Ctrl+S" is used to "Save & Exit", all that is really needed is j=<br>
ust "S".)<br>
<br>
11. Press the "0" key (the zero key, not the alphabetic "O" key)=<br>
. Now the two digit number following that colon near the start of the first=<br>
line reads "00" instead of "01". Next press the "S" key to save this small=<br>
memory change and return to the Hex Viewer display screen. I believe that =<br>
we have just told the MailStation there are no email accounts currently set=<br>
up.<br>
<br>
12. Press the "Back" button to exit the Hex Viewer and return to the =<br>
"DIAGNOSTIC MAIN MENU" screen.<br>
<br>
13. Press the "Q" key to exit this screen. =<br>
A "Test Over" message briefly appears on the screen and then we see a "Scan=<br>
ning memory data" progress bar followed by the the "Reset System Data" menu=<br>
again. This time, it does not include the "Restore Default Account" menu i=<br>
tem. The "No Clear" menu item is highlighted. Press the "Enter" key. We now=<br>
see a prompt for "Please create a new user account." with an "OK" response=<br>
highlighted. Press the "Enter" key. We now see a "User Settings" screen wh=<br>
ere we can input a response to each of the following prompts:<br>
<br>
User N=<br>
ame:<br>
Dial-Up No:<br>
Reply-To:<br>
____________________________________=<br>
_________________<br>
E-Mail Address:<br>
E-Mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SM=<br>
TP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
Once we have=<br>
assigned a value to each prompt, press the F1 key which is now labelled "S=<br>
ave" at the bottom of the screen. The new user account data is saved and we=<br>
are left in the main "MailStation 250" menu.<br>
<br>
For my own personal purpos=<br>
es, I would like to see the MailStation be set up to run just about any typ=<br>
e of operating system or other underlying system that then supports some ve=<br>
rsion of Microsoft Basic. It could be MBasic under CP/M or it could be a Ba=<br>
sic interpreter from one of the TRS-80 computers. I would even consider the=<br>
very original Microsoft Basic interpreter, the one written for the Altair =<br>
8800. I helped a friend build his Altair 8800 many years ago and we wrote m=<br>
any programs on his system. I would at least want the version intended for =<br>
8K because the 4k version did not really support character strings. So I am=<br>
pretty easy to satisfy. I have become aware of FyberOptic and his FyOS ope=<br>
rating system but have not had time to totally gage its current state, avai=<br>
lability, and applicability. In any case, I congratulate Jeff, Cyrano, Don,=<br>
and others who have contributed so much of their time and sweat to uncover=<br>
the secrets of these neat little computers.<br>

do know from reading many of the messages in this group that the 350 does n=<br>

in its ROMs will likely be very different. Does that mean that the data in =<br>
RAM is laid out the same? Well, it could be but I would bet against it. So =<br>
I would expect that these procedures would not work exactly as I have writt=<br>
