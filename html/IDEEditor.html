Hi Don,<br>
<br>
I am using programmers notepad, which I got as part of<br>
winavr=<br>
.  All I had to do to get it to work with SDCC was<br>
to create a new makefil=<br>
e, with commands to compile with<br>
SDCC.<br>
<br>
I discovered how easy it was to us=<br>
e with SDCC by<br>
accident, when I was looking at some sdcc code in<br>
wordpad. =<br>
I think my brain has gotten used to seeing<br>
C code with color syntax highl=<br>
ighting, and it was kind<br>
of grating to look at everything in the same colo=<br>
r.<br>
<br>
So I thought I would open the file in winavr's<br>
"programmers notepad", =<br>
just to edit it, and then<br>
compile it with the bat file I had been using wit=<br>
h<br>
wordpad.  Well, it didn't take too long for me to<br>
wonder if I could get a=<br>
makefile to run the bat<br>
file.  Before I tried that, it clicked in my head<br>
=<br>
that I did not need the bat, I could just use<br>
the makefile!<br>
<br>
You don't need=<br>
winavr to get programmers notepad, but<br>
I think you might need at least th=<br>
e gnu binutils<br>
to use "make" (installs as part of winavr suite).<br>
<br>
There is =<br>
one quirk to programmers notepad (and it<br>
may have something to do with the =<br>
fact I am using it<br>
under win98), but the "output window" has a habit<br>
of dis=<br>
appearing, and sometimes dialogs (like "open")<br>
appear underneath the other =<br>
windows.  It's only<br>
mildly annoying after you understand what is happening.=<br>
<br>
Some features I really like are the "tabbed" multiple<br>
editor windows, wh=<br>
ere you can keep several files open,<br>
and the ability to select columns of =<br>
text for<br>
cutting/pasting.  Also, it makes error messages (even<br>
from SDCC) =<br>
into clickable links, and puts cursor<br>
on the error line when you click one.=<br>
And the color<br>
syntax hightlighting, of course!<br>
