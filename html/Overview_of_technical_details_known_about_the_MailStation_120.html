ATL modem/fax chip<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, it's 2400 limited.  S=<br>
o the earlier ones used the trellis style<br>
modems.  Nice.  I designed a 2400=<br>
bps, years (nah, decades) ago. Never<br>
tried my hand at the fancy trellis st=<br>
uff, though.<br>
<br>
<br>
een worked out, as far as documenting<br>
he "new development"<br>
<br>
Nothing =<br>
new happening?<br>
<br>
I'd like to get complete specs on the various peripheral co=<br>
mponents<br>
that exist surrounding the micro.  I'd like to get the datasheet o=<br>
n<br>
the micro, itself, so that I can see what internal peripheral support<br>
it =<br>
has and how it is attached to the rest.  I'd like to get the<br>
protocols used=<br>
for the LCD (does it have it's own controllers?  if so,<br>
which?  if not, wh=<br>
at are the details for the LCD in terms of timing<br>
diagrams and the like?)  =<br>
Etc.<br>
<br>
Here's what I want eventually to do.  I've two things in mind (one is=<br>
<br>
a BASIC interpreter and using the printer port for an I/O bus for<br>
extender=<br>
boards.)  Both depend on getting a decent, modern development<br>
setup for it=<br>
, though.  So for now, the main thing is to design a<br>
daughter board to repl=<br>
ace the existing cpu.  Or else get some<br>
convincing evidence that I should j=<br>
ust keep it there.<br>
<br>
It might be smarter for me to first use SDCC with the e=<br>
xisting system<br>
until I gain enough experience with it.  But right now, I'm =<br>
not sure<br>
how to proceed there.  I gather already that the CPU core is Z80-l=<br>
ike,<br>
but that doesn't tell me a great deal by itself.  (I used to do a lot<br>
=<br>
of 8080 and 8085 programming before the Z80 even existed and got my<br>
hands o=<br>
n Z80 assembly work with the TRS-80, memory serving.)  I have<br>
SDCC loaded, =<br>
already, and integrated into the SiLabs IDE for<br>
compilation, right now.  I =<br>
can use it with a DOS box, though.  Anyway,<br>
how does compiled output (hex f=<br>
iles, perhaps?) get burned into the<br>
system?  Is there a mechanism that's be=<br>
en worked out and works well?<br>
What hardware tools are involved in that?  Et=<br>
c.<br>
<br>
If I do this way first, it will allow me a 'slow ramp' into<br>
understandi=<br>
ng the hardware details more intimately, before deciding if<br>
I should jump o=<br>
ff the cliff and place another CPU in there.  An<br>
extremely low power one wo=<br>
uld be the MSP430 (has extremely good start<br>
up from sleep times) or some of=<br>
the newer PICs or even the SiLab parts<br>
(one I'm using now is about the onl=<br>
y thing going for a decent 1MHz<br>
16-bit SAR ADC no matter what family you wa=<br>
nt to talk about.)  Atmel<br>
has some interesting parts, as well.  And there a=<br>
re many, many ARM<br>
choices -- though most suck a little too much power for m=<br>
y taste.  I<br>
like things under 2mA on the CPU when it is running full out an=<br>
d under<br>
10uA with a decent timer or two plus brown-out and a comparator<br>
run=<br>
ning.  So that drops ARMs out, mostly.  But I love the parts<br>
because of the=<br>
great compiler support from gcc.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I started to read today.  I supp=<br>
ose I can slog through on my<br>
own, if you assure me a lot is out there to re=<br>
ad.  But if you can<br>
point me faster, I'd sure appreciate that a lot.  The f=<br>
aster I figure<br>
out the barriers, the faster I can get going.<br>
<br>
Also, do you =<br>
know where one can pick up more of these new 120's?  Or<br>
new 150's?  Cheap! =<br>
I picked up two at $5 and I just found another I<br>
can get at the same price=<br>
, still in the box.  But if I do this, I<br>
might want to make 100 or so.  (Sc=<br>
hool stuff, teaching tool of sorts.)<br>
Since I'd give them away, they need to=<br>
be cheap.  If you know of any<br>
nice stockpile of them that hasn't been grou=<br>
nd into powder already and<br>
where the owner might consider getting at least =<br>
'something' rather<br>
than having to pay for garbage disposal to get back the =<br>
shelf space,<br>
I'd like to know about it.<br>

there has been no traffic on=<br>

<br>
And it's been over a year since I did anything on this=<br>
project.<br>
<br>
I was working up a c header to use the mailstation rom<br>
functions=<br>
that I had figured out (and I figured out<br>
quite a bit, if I do say so myse=<br>
lf!)   :-)<br>
<br>
It's in file section, under "Mailstation Toolkit".<br>
<br>
I have some=<br>
stuff I didn't upload, in particular a<br>
perl script I was working on, to c=<br>
onvert resource strings<br>
& graphics into format that works with the mailsta=<br>
tion<br>
lib functions.  You just link the resource data with<br>
your c code, usi=<br>
ng sdcc.<br>
<br>
And I was working on a makefile to compile mailstation<br>
apps with=<br>
sdcc.<br>
<br>
nents<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure that everything known about the hardware is<br>
i=<br>
n the file area, in particular the "part files" folder.<br>
<br>
Also, there is a l=<br>
ist of known models in the group's database<br>
section, where some of the dif=<br>
ferences are documented.<br>
<br>
There are manufacturer datasheets for representat=<br>
ive codeflash,<br>
dataflash, and ram chips, and a few on some of the modems.<br>
T=<br>
here are notes on the cpu, lcd, and keyboard, where we never<br>
found actual =<br>
datasheets.  AFAICT, they are good enough, and<br>
not having actual datasheets=<br>
is not holding anything back.<br>
<br>
I suppose the main thing lacking is data on=<br>
the blue LCD.<br>
<br>
The mailstation models are all quite similar (except 350). =<br>
<br>
The differences I can think of off hand are:<br>
Various manufacturers of me=<br>
mory chips.<br>
Ergonomic models have a slightly different keyboard matrix.<br>
1=<br>
20 & 150 both were made with two kinds of LCD.<br>
Caller ID chip only in whit=<br>
e/cream colored units.<br>
Various modem chips (diff speeds)<br>
250 has cordless=<br>
phone chipset.<br>
Probably at least 20 different firmware versions.<br>
<br>
The sim=<br>
ilarities (except 350, and diff noted above):<br>
One Megabyte codeflash.<br>
512=<br>
KByte dataflash.<br>
128 KByte ram.<br>
All have same cpu (z80 inst set).<br>
Port =<br>
& Memory Maps are all the same.<br>
320 x 128 monochrome LCD (but 2 diff types=<br>
exist).<br>
Parallel port.<br>
<br>
I'm just going from memory, and it has been a few=<br>

rful processor?  Bear in mind what you<br>
can buy a netbook, or used notebook =<br>
for.<br>
<br>
By the way, the cpu is 128 pins, and small enough to hide under a dim=<br>
e.<br>
I can't think of an easy (and good, and cheap) way to connect a<br>
sub-boa=<br>
rd.  But you could put new cpu inside case, and still connect<br>
it as a term=<br>
inal (fewer wires).<br>
<br>
e existing system<br>
I'm not sure<br>
s Z80-like,<br>
do a lot<br>
my<br>
=<br>
n, right now.  I can use it with a DOS box, though.  Anyway,<br>
piled output (hex files, perhaps?) get burned into the<br>
a mechanism that's been worked out and works well?<br>
e involved in that?  Etc.<br>
<br>
The most recent method I used involved poking a =<br>
few bytes into<br>
dataflash with ms built-in hex-editor, and loading a larger<br>
=<br>
block of code into the ms splash-screen file with "mailbug", a<br>
debugger for=<br>
ms that I wrote (in file section).  The code entered<br>
via hex-editor is in =<br>
location ms uses for "loadable apps", and<br>
when you run that short "app", it=<br>
jumps to the larger block in the<br>
splash-screen area of the dataflash.<br>
<br>
I'=<br>
m a little fuzzy on exactly the steps, but I used the code in<br>
splash-screen=<br>
to load another app into the app area of the<br>
dataflash.  This one shows up=<br>
with an icon in the ms menu,<br>
and it interfaces with mailbug to load other =<br>
apps.<br>
Since it is in dataflash, it is persistent (I didn't<br>
have to go thru =<br>
this whole procedure every time I loaded<br>
a new program.)<br>
<br>
So, then I could=<br>
click on this "bootloader" icon in ms menu,<br>
and then load hex files over a=<br>
laplink cable, using<br>
mailbug on the PC end.<br>
<br>
I didn't write a bootloader t=<br>
o load directly to dataflash.<br>
I was loading apps into ms ram with mailbug, =<br>
executing them,<br>
then a small piece of code included in app copied the app =<br>
<br>
from ram to another empty app slot in dataflash.  Whew!<br>
But it worked!!!=<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I executed at a special entrypoint to run the<br>
"install" co=<br>
de, which would call ms firmware to copy the<br>
ram image to the dataflash.  A=<br>
fter it had been copied<br>
to dataflash, when running the loaded app from the=<br>
ms menu,<br>
app would start from the normal entrypoint (iow, the first byte)=<br>
.<br>
<br>
Earlier methods involved overwriting the codeflash with<br>
similar bootload=<br>
er, but that killed the ms for normal<br>
operation as a mailstation.<br>
<br>
The proc=<br>
ess is documented somewhere in file section, or<br>
possibly in a message post =<br>
(almost 2 yrs ago, aprrox).<br>
I'll see if I can find it, if I ever finish rea=<br>

One thing on my todo list (that I di=<br>

a simpler command-line loader that could run from=<br>

makefile, when you did "make program", so I could compile<br>
and load fro=<br>

<br>
When I was working under win=<br>

Lately I am using Ubuntu, where at first I use=<br>
d<br>
"gedit" as IDE, but recently I found "geany" which I<br>
really like.  It i=<br>

"programmers notepad", in that it is based =<br>
