<hr><h3>Subject: Success reconfiguring ISP on MS 120 with ROM v 4.05e</h3>
<p class="from">From: "Carl Hauser" &lt;chauserx@...></p>
<p class="date">Jul 23, 2005</p>
<p class="formattedBody">I had previously been unable to reconfigure the ISP on my MS 120 with<br>
v 4.05e using the "reset during power on" trick. Although it produced<br>
the "erase all settings" option, the Earthlink ISP settings were not<br>
erased.<br>
<br>
After using the information below about entering diagnostics mode and<br>
choosing the FAST TEST option when the machine rebooted at the end of<br>
the test the machine rebooted it had no ISP info and allowed me to<br>
set up a new account. (Warning: FAST TEST erases everything in the<br>
machine.)<br>
<br>
Full sequence:<br>
Hold down &lt;function>&lt;q>&lt;a> and press power on. Continue holding<br>
Enter<br>
qa781206&lt;enter><br>
in the box.<br>
Enter<br>
2<br>
to choose FAST TEST.<br>
The first four tests are quick. The ROM test takes about 20 seconds.<br>
Wait for it. Eventually the screen changes to say<br>
Battery TESTING with a box below.<br>
The box will get filled in with<br>
Battery HIGH<br>
Now hit &lt;enter>&lt;Back><br>
and you're back at the Diagnostic Main Menu. Enter<br>
q<br>
to quit and reboot. You'll get the menu of options to clear various<br>
things. It doesn't seem to matter what you choose -- the next message<br>
is "Please create a new user account".<br>
<br>
Enjoy.<br>
