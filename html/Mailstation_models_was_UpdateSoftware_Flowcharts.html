I would agree, the 120 and 150 are nearly identical, and<br>
probably not even much difference in the software.<br>
<br>
I have a 120, and on the back of the case it says<br>
"mivo 200".  Does anybody here remember when the models<br>
were 100, 200, 300?  And what the difference was between 100, and 200?<br>
I've nerer even seen a 200 listed on ebay, did they ever release one?<br>
I bet the 120 is a reflashed 200.  My 120 has 3 layers of serial<br>
number stickers.<br>
<br>
I also have a strong hunch that the "white mailstations"  (mivo 100/mailstation 100)<br>
are really leftover e-message units, reflashed to version 3.03a.<br>
<br>
The emessage's, that AFAIK were marketed thru phone companies,<br>
functioned as a  caller id device, and the 100's have the caller id<br>
chip, but no caller id function.<br>
<br>
I have a white emessage unit, with v2.21 software.  The lowest<br>
version I have seen in a brown unit is 2.22.<br>
<br>
Also, my white mailstation 100 has a second serial#<br>
sticker over the original.<br>
<br>
I noticed that most of the serial numbers I had started with 99.<br>
But then I noticed one that started with 00, and it was newer.<br>
And my 150 starts with 01,  And then I noticed the only<br>
white one I had started with 02.  At first it seemed odd<br>
that the oldest had the highest serial numbers, then I<br>
realized it was probably a date code.  If it works like<br>
the date codes on IC chips (4 digits), then the first 4 digits<br>
of the serial number is YYWW (2 digit year, 2 digit week,<br>
where last week in Dec. is 52)<br>
<br>
Real interesting, I know, but I peeled the sticker off of<br>
my 100, and the one on the bottom had date code in 99!<br>
<br>
So thats why I think the white ones are really the oldest<br>
models, just with a "newer" version of the software.  And<br>
as far as I can tell, the main differences are:  This new<br>
version has no caller id, even though the caller id chip is<br>
still inside;  The fax send has been removed;  They are<br>
now limited to a single user.<br>
<br>
<br>
The clipmail commands (that are embedded in certain special<br>
email messages) come in over the phone line.<br>
See messages 83, 90, 91.<br>
