a det1 mailstation, and I've been looking around for ways to hack it<br>

do, so any info would be super awsome.<br>

Yes you can do this. But this question is answered once a week, so<br>
please search the archive. Searching with the phrase "isp" or "my own<br>
isp" should do it...<br>
<br>
We really need to put a FAQ list...<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Wooh, I was able to do it. My det1 succesfully logs into netzero.<br>
one problem though, when it tries to connect to the netzero mail<br>
server, it gets the error "the email service is busy or unavailable.<br>
please try again later." Same thing goes with my yahoo account. I'm<br>
pretty sure i put in the right pop3 and smtp adress. maybe its the<br>
fact that my email adress is .net, and the pop3 and smtp adresses<br>
are .com, though i dont think that's it.  hmm... do you guys know of<br>
any free email places that work well with it?<br>
Oh and is the yahoo option functional at all? all i get is a clear<br>
screen.<br>

AFAIK they dumped the service after a year. I bought a used machine with two<br>
of the messages still inside - neat! I'd like to figure it out and 'fix' it<br>
to work again.<br>

I got a couple recently that have a "MyCIDCO" icon on the main<br>
menu.  This must be a replacement for the "My Yahoo" function.<br>
<br>
One has TV listings & weather for Jan 6, 2005.  The other<br>
had news, and something else, also from this year (I guess I<br>
erased it with the "flash test").  So, it would seem that<br>
Earthlink was still providing it in January.<br>
<br>
The info is stored in the first 8 pages of the dataflash, one page<br>
for each item in the sub-menu under mycidco.  I just get a blank<br>
page now on the one I erased, with a "mycidco" tab at the top.<br>
But there used to be two icons on that page, and selecting one<br>
would display a page of data.  The data for the page is stored<br>
as one big bitmap graphic.<br>
<br>
I don't think there is a lot of hope of using it as intended,<br>
without a mailstation account from Earthlink.  Even if you could<br>
get the data into those pages (I suspect it uses the "clipmail"<br>
extensions to pop protocol), where would you get the data to load?<br>
<br>
But it might be a way to add some new functions to the<br>
ms menu.  It doesn't have to be tv listing or news, it<br>
can be any code you want.  I spliced some code into the<br>
eventhadler, and it runs whenever you select the icon, or<br>
any key is pressed, while viewing the associated data page.<br>
(I just made it blink the mail LED.)<br>
<br>
It probably won't look very good after yahoo smashes all the<br>
indenting out, but here is the format of each item/page:<br>
