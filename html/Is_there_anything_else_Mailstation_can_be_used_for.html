No paper, it can't receive or scan.<br>

Don't forget, people here are working on cracking the code so these can be<br>
used for various tasks.<br>

It may be possible to add a Basic interpreter and use them as a<br>
computer/word processor.<br>

IIRC, the earlier 2.xx models have the sendfa=<br>
x<br>
capability.  iow, the white eMessage, & the dark brown<br>
mailstation befor=<br>
e the mivo name was used.<br>
<br>
The 3.xx models (mailstation/mivo 100's) are t=<br>
he same<br>
white or brown too, but I don't know if they have the<br>
sendfax capa=<br>
bility.<br>
<br>
Pretty sure none of the 4.xx ergonomic case models have it.<br>
<br>
In 2.=<br>
53yr there is a function that I named as:<br>
byte sendfax(char *faxnumber, cha=<br>

*username);<br>
in the mailstation.h header I u=<br>
ploaded back in Febuary.<br>
I have never tried to call it yet, but I imagine i=<br>
t will<br>
send a fax if it is called.<br>
