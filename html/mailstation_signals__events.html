<p class="formattedBody">I don't really know what these should be called.  I<br>
named the "event type" =<br>
field as "signal" in my notes.<br>
There is a queue that the events and such ar=<br>
e placed in.<br>
At first I was calling it "msgQ", when I didn't have any<br>
idea=<br>
what the messages were.<br>
<br>
When I realized some of them were keyboard input,=<br>
I<br>
changed it to "eventQ".  But then I noticed some of the<br>
items did not ma=<br>
tch my idea of "event", such as signal #0d<br>
which means "draw yourself".  Ma=<br>
ny of the signals are what<br>
I would call "commands" rather than "events".<br>
<br>
T=<br>
hese are the signals that I have figured out so far.<br>
Some are just guesses,=<br>
based on what *seemed* to be<br>
happening where I saw them used.  (I am quite=<br>
sure that<br>
01 thru 0d are correct.)  These values are passed<br>
to your apps "=<br>
handleevent" function, in the "signal" param.<br>

;; signals:<br>
01  - init app<br>
0=<br>
2 - ???<br>
03 - go prev<br>
04 - go main<br>
05 - timer<br>
06 - keydown, top keyrow  (may=<br>
be should call it buttondown???)<br>
07 - keyup, top keyrow<br>

widget as<br>

Great detective work.<br>
<br>
I think you had it right in the first place: looks like a garden<br>
variety message queue. Having all events placed on the queue allows a<br>
simple idle loop where your app is just a big switch case in which you<br>
process the next message from the queue. Most GUI programs are<br>
architected this way: your application is associated with a window<br>
which is associated with a message queue. All mouse and keyboard<br>
events typically go into the queue; the same for paint events, button<br>
clicks, etc. It looks like init/cleanup (lifecycle) also go through<br>
the event queue.<br>
<br>
The reason for a message queue like this is typically to keep<br>
interrupt latency low (post to queue and process messages on idle<br>
and/or bottom half of interrupt handler, i.e. run only when it is<br>
safe). It also facilitates cooperative multitasking since the "kernel"<br>
can easily switch between processing the queue for one application to<br>
another without disruption.<br>
