<p class="formattedBody">I have a black 120 v4.0SE<br>
<br>
I have it configured with my POP3 yahoo account.  Changing the<br>
settings took me a couple of minutes using the great advice from here,<br>
but I can't send email.  I keep getting a message saying that the<br>
server is busy and to try again later.  But I can wait and wait but<br>
still get the same message.  All of my information is correct<br>
including the SMTP.  Does anyone know of any issues that exist with<br>
yahoo.  I have a premier yahoo account and have enabled POP3.  Doesn't<br>
make sense that I can receive and not send.<br>
