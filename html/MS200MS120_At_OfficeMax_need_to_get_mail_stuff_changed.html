<p class="formattedBody">I see lots of stuff on this list for 100, 120, etc. But my local<br>
(Victoria TX) store has the MS200/DET2 machines (which strangely come<br>
up with the screen saying it is a "MailStation 120"). I have 4<br>
reserved **IF** I can change the email data. I've been trying this<br>
morning to use the<br>
Function-D<br>
Push in the reset with a toothpick<br>
Pull out the power<br>
<br>
I do see a different menu, but now what?<br>
<br>
Normal reset menu:<br>
Heading: Reset System Data<br>
then<br>
No Clear<br>
Clear E-Mail Data<br>
Clear Address Book Data<br>
Clear All Data<br>
<br>
When I do the Function-D dance shown above, I get a menu that is:<br>
Heading: Reset System Data<br>
then<br>
Restore Default Account<br>
Clear E-Mail Data<br>
Clear Address Book Data<br>
Clear All Data<br>
<br>
Now what?<br>
I can NEVER get it to come up with a set of input solicitations that<br>
ask me for the email info I really need to push into the machine.<br>
<br>
Another query:<br>
What if I fix this one and send it to a computer illiterate cousin or<br>
my ditto mother? Will the info hold? Or will I require them to mail it<br>
back every time the batteries go flat? How often must the complicated<br>
maneuver be repeated in 'normal' use?<br>
<br>
I know that is really more than one query, but I'm holding off on a<br>
60-mile round trip pending the answers.<br>

Hayelp, pliz.<br>

Choose "Restore Default Account" and "Yes".  The instructions said to<br>
press Enter and immediately pull the plug, but I found that it works if<br>
you press Enter and reset.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure, maybe someone else knows.  Try taking the batteries out<br>
and letting it sit for a few days.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">It all about the timing. You have to get it just right<br>
when you try to corrupt the flash memory. You got to<br>
do it right after it delete the old data and before it<br>
write new data back to the flash memory.  You may have<br>
to try 10 ... 20 time. Good luck,<br>
