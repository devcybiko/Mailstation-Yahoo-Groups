<p class="formattedBody">Has anyone been able to make use of the MyCIDCO Info part of a stock<br>
mailstation? I have mine set up to receive my POP3 e-mail just fine,<br>
but it would also be nice to be able to use the Info part. Would it be<br>
possible for me to set up a website so my mailstation can go out and<br>
get the weather, news, etc. just like it would if hooked to Earthlink?<br>
If so, how?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<p class="formattedBody">What mailstation do you have?  Thats been the $64000 question I've had<br>
all along is how to spoof this thing into going to another POP3 server.<br>
<br>
Does anyone want to buy 1 or 2 blue Mailstations as new?  One is new in<br>
box.  Neither has been registered.  I just won one of the older ones<br>
that will fill my needs better.<br>
<br>
Offers?  Trades?  Audreys?  Model 100s?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Hi Ronny,<br>
I have the Mivo 350 Cordless V.1.35 (black).  I received mine<br>
yesterday, went into setup, deleted out the previous user's info and<br>
was able to change everything. I am wanting it for my mother who<br>
wants something simple just for e-mail. (My father has an ISP for<br>
business, so she has her own POP3 e-mail account.)  She's now using a<br>
3com Audrey which I fixed for her.  Problem is that Audrey is very bad<br>
about dialing up, getting e-mail, but not hanging up in a timely<br>
manner.  (This Mailstation dials, gets e-mail, then hangs up<br>
immediately!)<br>
<br>
I just thought it would also be nice to be able to give her a little<br>
bonus with the MyCIDCO Info stuff.  I have been to<br>
www.linux-hacker.net and wasn't able to find anything about MyCIDCO.<br>
There was a lot of info on going to another POP3 and much other type<br>
of hacking.<br>
<br>
had<br>
server.<br>
new in<br>
ones<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Unfortunatley I bought two of the "Blue" ones.  These are locked down to<br>
the Earthlink servers.  I really don't think it's possible yet to<br>
reflash it.  I bought one off eBay that is the non wireless version I<br>
think will work for what I wanted to do.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">I can't give you a guarantee BUT, experience teaches me that all of these<br>
units from the Mivo 100 and up will reflash with the same hardware and<br>
possibly the same software. Why re-invent the wheel? So once that's cracked,<br>
they'll all be open. Early investigation shows that there is plenty of ROM<br>
space unused - enough for a Basic interpreter for example.<br>

reflash one of these?<br>

Someone is going to figure this out an build a reflash station. But it'll be<br>
someone with in depth knowledge of electronics and Z-80 code. Once he does<br>
this, you'll all be sending your Mailstations in to be 'fixed'. I want to<br>
convert mine into a sort of super Radio Shack model 100 computer.<br>
<br>
This is not a job to do-it-yourself.<br>

Actually, I saw a special test clip for the TSOP flash parts like those<br>
in the Mailstation a few months back, I may be able to dig up the link.<br>
Just solder some wires and connect it to a programmer properly, I think<br>
you would be set. More efficient than having to use a rework station to<br>
lift the part and add a part w/ a documented bootloader/flash burn code<br>
<br>
Of course if all the units can be reflashed through the software<br>
mechanisms we're better off all around. I just have to get around to<br>
testing CJs code on my various units. Too many projects.<br>

I'm assuming they can be reflashed via the parallel printer port, since it<br>
seems to be clear that the code is there to do that.<br>

There's code there, but there's no guarantee that it is in all versions<br>
of the ROM, or that all versions behave the same, or that future<br>
firmware revisions/updates won't rip it out.<br>
<br>
The parallel port routines are sort of a developer's back-door. As you<br>
know, in the field the units are upgraded via special cryptographically<br>
protected email messages. So they could take this stuff out any time,<br>
unless it's part of their manufacturing process.<br>
<br>
But I imagine they would be assembling the boards with the parts already<br>
programmed.<br>
<br>
Basically, we just need to verify it with CJs code. Everything is in<br>
place to move forward, it's just a matter of who has time to get it<br>
done.<br>
