<p class="formattedBody">Hello,<br>
<br>
My mother has been using her Mailstation for many years, but she is=<br>
thinking of getting another device to use, possibly an iPad or a computer.=<br>
she does not want to change her email address. Is there a way for her to s=<br>
end and receive from her Mailstation account on another device, or is the a=<br>
ccount somehow locked to the mailstation?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time,<br>

<p class="formattedBody">It is a normal POP3 and SMTP email account. You can log into it using<br>
their webmail from any browser. But you have to know what passwords were<br>
used in setting it up.<br>
<br>
There is the ISP account and password, which you will not use if you<br>
already have internet access on the new device (it is for dial-up access).<br>
<br>
Then you have the email account and password.  If you already have<br>
internet access, you can use Microsoft Outlook or something else to<br>
connect to the incoming mail server and outgoing mail server.  Or go to<br>
www.Earthlink.com  and use the webmail access tab on the upper right.<br>
Enter the email address ( "user"@...) and then your email<br>
password.  The browser will open up on the email account, and you can send<br>
and receive from it.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">What Wayne said.  Each MailStation account has an associated Earthlink webm=<br>
ail account and it is easy to access from anywhere just like any webmail ac=<br>
count.  In fact, I think all the mail really goes there first then is actua=<br>
lly downloaded by the MailStation device which acts as a "mail client" (I'm=<br>
not too technical so I could be wrong, but it looked that way in mom's, al=<br>
though sometimes stuff would appear one place but not the other or vanish f=<br>
rom webmail once downloaded to the MailStation?)<br>
<br>
However, you might point =<br>
out to her the following:<br>
<br>
1) If she keeps the account, it will cost her an=<br>
other $10/month or whatever Earthlink is now charging for MailStation e-mai=<br>
l (my mom died just over a year ago), in addition to her cost of an ISP for=<br>
the new device (even if she foolishly uses Earthlink for that, I don't thi=<br>
nk they'll cooperate on the MailStation account - see #2)<br>
<br>
2) Earthlink is =<br>
aggressively trying to let MailStation die out; they will not make any chan=<br>
ges to accounts nor open new ones, and what little and poor "support" is av=<br>
ailable is through CSRs in India or Pakistan<br>
<br>
If she indeed changes, why no=<br>
t try to get her the same e-mail name on a nice webmail account or her new =<br>
ISP, if available, e.g., from "MotherName123@..." (or @mymailstatio=<br>
n.com or whatever she is using) to "MotherName123@..." or @yahoo or @=<br>
newISP.  We did this with my mom's when she was no longer able to drive her=<br>
own MailStation anymore, and it enabled me to access her e-mail and answer=<br>
it for her FREE (vs. accessing it through EL webmail for $10 per month ext=<br>
ra).  It was easy to use the old MailStation to send one last "change of e-=<br>
mail address" e-mail to all her contacts, and the thing has a printer port =<br>
(LPT1 - Centronics type) to print out her address book.  That would have to=<br>
manually be input into the new account (and even into the associated Earth=<br>
link webmail account; the addresses are in I guess flash memory on the devi=<br>
ce itself), unless you are smart enough to make a program to convert them f=<br>
rom a print file.  (I actually used an OCR scanner on the printed pages of =<br>
Mom's)<br>
<br>
Hope this info helps.  If she's not short on cash, I guess just let=<br>
her pay the extra $10/month to avoid hassles (until EL pulls the plug on M=<br>
ailStation entirely).  My mom was always scrambling to save a buck, as are =<br>
most seniors on fixed incomes.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">YES, Earthlink is no longer supporting the Mailstations. But they are NOT<br>
actively trying to close those accounts (that I am aware of). They will<br>
just NOT open a new mailstation account or can no longer swap mailstations<br>
on an account (if yours is broken). That is because the special<br>
mailstation server that they had setup is no longer running to be able to<br>
do that.<br>
<br>
But you can use the Mailstation account just like any other Earthlink<br>
webmail account or dial-up email account.  It uses the same SMTP and POP3<br>
protocols Gmail or others use.<br>
<br>
I do wish they would allow others to see the programming on the<br>
mailstation devices, so we could then keep existing accounts running, and<br>
install units on new accounts.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">If you are going to continue to use Earthlink as the "dial-up" Service<br>
provider, then you would have the following settings.<br>
<br>
1. For the connection for the ISP: (on Earthlink)<br>
<br>
The Dial-up telephone number;<br>
The Dial-up User Name;<br>
The Dial-up Password;<br>
The ISP DNS number;<br>
<br>
2. For the Actual Email Account: (on Earthlink)<br>
<br>
The Email User Name;  (mom@...)<br>
The Email Password;<br>
The Email SMTP server; (smtp.mailstation.com)<br>
The Email POP3 server; (pop.mailstation.com)<br>
<br>
If you are going to be using DSL or Cable modem to get your ISP service,<br>
you would not need section 1.<br>
<br>
Section 2 is almost worldwide standard for all email client software, even<br>
such as Microsoft Express and Microsoft Outlook. The SMTP server uses Port<br>
25, and the POP3 server uses Port 110.  If you are using another ISP for<br>
Section 1, make sure they are NOT blocking Port 25 on your connection with<br>
them, so you will be able to send out email. Most do block it to eliminate<br>
spam being sent out on their system, and to get you to use their email<br>
service.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps ?<br>
