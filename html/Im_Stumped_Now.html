Check the SPAM and firewall settings on your email account setup.<br>
That is going to decide what you allow in and what you bounce.<br>
Might also check your SPAM box to see if they went there !!<br>

One quick way to find out is to drop your Spam filter, and have her send you<br>
a message.<br>
Also, there should be a box in your email account setup for selecting Text<br>
or Mime output.<br>
<br>
Then ALL your emails will be sent as the same way.  You could also check<br>
with Yahoo and see<br>
if they did a software change about 10 days ago ??<br>
<br>
Had a similar problem when our ISP changed us to new IP addresses. It seems<br>
the new IP's<br>
were listed as SPAM originating IP's by a Spam blocker, and Google and Yahoo<br>
wouldn't<br>
process them, just dropped them.  Once the blocking was taken off the IP<br>
addresses, we<br>
had no problem sending them.<br>
<br>
Get the IP address off her machine and run it through a Spam check (search<br>
for it on the web).<br>

My little, very time consuming exercise in locating, identifying and<br>
testing the services of 'other' ISPs for our MailStations has shown<br>
only one that is head and shoulders above the rest. Earthlink being<br>
at the bottom.<br>
<br>
If you follow my previously published instructions on how to wipe<br>
your machine, contact BasicISP.net and for $6.95/month they can put<br>
you back on line. With any luck you may get your old address with a<br>
new 'extension' on it. They have shown themselves as being an outfit<br>
well worthy of our business. Their Customer Service quality and setup<br>
info and assistance is outstanding. They leave the others in the dust.<br>
<br>
All you need to ask for is:<br>
A dial up telco number that won't cost you a fortune,<br>
E-mail Address: (pretty well your choice)<br>
E-mail Password: (pretty well your choice)<br>
POP3 Server: Address<br>
SMTP Server: Address<br>
ISP Account ID on a 'POP3 Server' (very important)<br>
ISP Account Password:<br>
<br>
and most importantly, the Primary DNS Address.<br>
<br>
That's all you need during MailStation Account Setup programming and<br>
you're on-line.<br>
I've done it several times with a few prospective ISPs and only<br>
BasicISP came through with flying colours.<br>
<br>
Check them out for yourself.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to use me as a referral to them when you call. I'm<br>
'meema@...' on their books. I'm holding the address for my<br>
mother for next month when I'm switching her over.<br>
<br>
Or contact me if difficulties arise, please.<br>
<br>
Please consider the environment before printing this email note.<br>

I didn't change any settings on my Yahoo account(s) at all, and I<br>
check my Spam folder daily.  This just happened about 10 days ago.<br>
One day I was getting e-mails from Mom as I have for years, then the<br>
next day, I couldn't.  She's not getting "bounce" messages on them;<br>
they are just vanishing.  I had her verify that she was sending them<br>
to my correct address, and as stated in my original post, even had her<br>
"reply" to them from two different Yahoo accounts.  NOTHING!  I'm<br>
convinced it has something to do with her MailStation hardware, but I<br>
don't know what it could be.<br>
o do with her machine, I think.<br>
