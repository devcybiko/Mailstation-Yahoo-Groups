<p class="formattedBody">I thought I'd make a new topic regarding this, since I don't think<br>
it's be=<br>
en discussed before.<br>
<br>
Basically, I want to figure out the data structure of=<br>
the email<br>
stored in the dataflash.  I haven't investigated it thoroughly =<br>
yet,<br>
but I thought I'd post my preliminary findings, and perhaps see if<br>
s=<br>
omeone else might have learned more about it already before I spend<br>
any ti=<br>
me trying to figure it out.<br>
<br>
Here's what I've found so far.  Messages seem =<br>
to start with a 14 byte<br>
header, the first of which tends to always be 0xfd=<br>
.  It's followed by<br>
the subject line, null terminated, but the field alway=<br>
s appears to be<br>
142 bytes long, regardless of how short the subject really=<br>
is.  After<br>
that is the email recipient, immediately terminated by a null.=<br>
Then<br>
the message body, also terminated by null.  Then I think there's an=<br>
8<br>
byte footer of data.<br>
<br>
I've been doing various dumps after creating em=<br>
ails and such to<br>
compare the data.  I think the second byte of the email h=<br>
eaders<br>
possibly determines the status in some way, such as if it's deleted=<br>
<br>
or whatnot.<br>
<br>
I'd like to find an index or something, but I'm not sure if =<br>
one<br>
exists.  Perhaps it just reads through them all and constructs and<br>
in=<br>
dex in memory.<br>
<br>
I'll post more info as I get around to finding it.<br>

Funny you should ask.  I've been taking apart the "Inbox"<br>
a=<br>
pp, mainly because I want to understand how to use the<br>
scrolling text widg=<br>
et, and I just figured out the message<br>
header a couple of days ago.<br>
<br>
e's what I've found so far.  Messages seem to start<br>
r, the first of which tends to always<br>
<br>
The first 4 bytes are =<br>
a "file header", or maybe more<br>
correct, a "record header".  Either way, th=<br>
ese first<br>
4 bytes are part of the file system, not really part<br>
of the messa=<br>
ge.  The first byte is always FD, as you<br>
found. (I have seen FC, but I am =<br>
not sure what it means.<br>
It may mean a deleted record.)<br>
<br>
The second byte i=<br>
s a "file number" that tells what file<br>
the record belongs to.  Third and f=<br>
ourth bytes (word)<br>
are the file size, not counting the header iirc.<br>
The =<br>
rest is a variable amount of file data.<br>
<br>
I get the distinct impression that=<br>
each of these records<br>
holds one complete message.<br>
<br>
File/record format:<br>
<br>
=<br>
byte 0xFD<br>
byte filenumber<br>
word filesize<br>
data (message, addres=<br>
sbook, or calendar data)<br>
<br>
minated, but the field always appears to be<br>
f how short the subject really is.  After<br>
mmediately terminated by a null.  Then<br>
by null.  Then I think there's an 8<br>
<br>
I don't thi=<br>
nk there is a footer.  Perhaps what you<br>
see is the "directory" record???  F=<br>
or a file with<br>
only one data record, the directory record will be<br>
8 bytes (=<br>
I think).<br>
<br>
There does not seem to be any sort of text filenames<br>
used (I gue=<br>
ss embedded systems don't really need them).<br>
<br>
Each file has it's own direct=<br>
ory record.  These<br>
directory records are similar to the message<br>
records, w=<br>
ith the same 4 byte header format, except<br>
the file number is 0x40 + the fi=<br>
le number of the<br>
associated data records.<br>
<br>
The data portion of a directory =<br>
record is just a list<br>
of 4 byte addresses of the data records in that<br>
par=<br>
ticular file.<br>
<br>
There is a special sector (in dataflash page 8)<br>
That keeps=<br>
a list of the current addresses of<br>
the directory records.  This special se=<br>
ctor is<br>
the only part of dataflash that they keep a<br>
use-count for.  I supp=<br>
ose this is because that<br>
sector is re-written whenever any file is<br>
written,=<br>
and will get more use than any other<br>
sector.  When use-count reaches 10,00=<br>
0 it moves<br>
this special sector up to next sector.  There<br>
are 5 of these spe=<br>
cial sectors reserved, and<br>
after 50,000 writes, it starts re-using the<br>
sam=<br>
e 5 sectors.<br>
<br>
To top it all off, the 5th byte in the second-to-last<br>
sector =<br>
determines which of the 5 sectors is<br>
currently in use!<br>
<br>
But if you use the =<br>
mailstation's read function,<br>
(0x089F), you don't need to worry about all<br>
=<br>
these details.  ;^)<br>
<br>
You just need the following details...<br>
<br>
Message data f=<br>
ormat:<br>
<br>
word offset_to_body<br>
byte flagbits<br>
word year<br>
byte mo=<br>
nth<br>

byte hour<br>
byte min<br>
byte sec<br>
subjectstring =<br>
(padded to 142 dec bytes)<br>
fromstring ("tostring" in outbox)<br>
body of=<br>
message<br>
<br>
The "tostring" in outbox messages can be more<br>
than one email add=<br>
ress.<br>
<br>
flagbits xxxx xxx1 =3D new message<br>
<br>
The "new" bit, when in outbox, =<br>
seems to mean<br>
"ready to send".  Draft messages seem to be<br>
stored in outbo=<br>
x with this bit cleared.<br>
<br>
Several other bits have meaning, I'm not sure jus=<br>
t<br>
what.  Seems some might flag message as a "form"<br>
rather than normal messa=<br>
ge.  I have never seen one<br>
of these forms, but I think they are a way for<br>
c=<br>
idco to send a fill-out-form, with checkboxes<br>
and fill-in fields, to their =<br>
customers.  I think<br>
they get emailed back after being filled out.<br>
<br>
The file=<br>
numbers I have figured out so far:<br>
<br>
00 - ???<br>
01 - ???<br>
