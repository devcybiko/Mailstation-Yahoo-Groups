Hi,<br>
<br>
The short answer is: "no=<br>
".<br>
<br>
A longer answer: Not without a lot of work.<br>
Any input or output, or for=<br>
that matter any calls<br>
to the OS would have to be mapped to alternative<br>
cal=<br>
ls to the mailstations OS.  Unless, by some unlikely<br>
coincidence both the r=<br>
ex 6000 and the mailstation<br>
have the same low level firmware.<br>
<br>
use the Rex anymore but do have a bunch of files saved that have the<br>
rce code for some small apps and games.<br>
<br>
Is the source code in C or assem=<br>
bler?<br>
<br>
I had never heard of the Rex 6000 before now, but I googled it,<br>
and =<br>
spent some time reading about the hacking efforts last night.<br>
Seems they ar=<br>
e quite a bit further along than us!  (Heck, they were<br>
further in 2001 than=<br>
we are now!!!)<br>
<br>
Although the hardware is quite similar, I imagine there wo=<br>
uld be<br>
a lot of work involved in porting a rex 6000 app to mailstation,<br>
not=<br>
the least of would be reversing the existing mailstation OS,<br>
or writing a =<br>
new one.<br>
<br>
At one point there were a few group members who wanted to<br>
complet=<br>
ely rewrite the firmware.  I haven't heard much lately<br>
about any efforts in=<br>
that direction.  My own plan was to reverse<br>
enough of the existing firmwar=<br>
e so that we could use the existing OS,<br>
but that isn't moving very fast, ei=<br>
ther.<br>

sor<br>

If you set them up to dial-in and send email, then you can use them as<br>
