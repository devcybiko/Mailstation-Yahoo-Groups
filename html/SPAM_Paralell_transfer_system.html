Because I cant connect the device to download my mails yet. The ISP<br>
who provide the device in my country reserved for its own the<br>
configuration. So, I need an email account of the same service. I read<br>
that is possible to hack this 'ISP  protection' thing...so, can<br>
anybody help me?<br>
Greats, YACO<br>

Unfortunately, resetting the ISP configuration, if you have one of the<br>
Mailstations in which the setup is locked, currently requires a reset<br>
of the entire flash, erasing all of the email.<br>
<br>
There is a work-around, though, for not having an account.  It is<br>
possible to set up a desktop computer (typically with Linux as the OS)<br>
with a modem to answer when you dial in, and to pretend to be the ISP's<br>
computer.  It might be possible to set this up yourself, or to find a<br>
friend who can do this.  I believe that there is further information on<br>
this in the archived messages.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Finally I could connect my device to download my mails trought my ISP...<br>
but Im still loosing money in each call I have to make to cnnect it.<br>
The soultion wouldbe a prallel conecction, almost in one direction: I<br>
want to download my mails dorm the mailstation to the PC, but not put<br>
data inside the mailstation from de PC...however, i still have to make<br>
a programme to do that :(<br>
<br>
The other solution is that you mention. But I think that I may need a<br>
winmodem to connect the device to the computer, and everyone knows the<br>
problems of GNU/Linux to support winmodems...If I could sort this<br>
problem i need to know what program I need to run on the computer so<br>
the mailstation belives its connected to a real ISP. It would be nice<br>
that someone write something about this "emulation" or give me some<br>
data to make it on my own. :D<br>
<br>
I hope someone help me, thanx!<br>
