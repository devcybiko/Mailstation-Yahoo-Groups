<p class="formattedBody">Since I sometimes don't know for sure if a particular parameter can<br>
be use=<br>
d with a certain Z80 instruction, I just try it anyway, and<br>
then see if it=<br>
compiles.  If I get an error, I just check the<br>
datasheet, and then learn =<br>
from my mistake.  Well it seems that<br>
there's a little bug in AS80 which ca=<br>
uses a minor issue if you try a<br>
particular invalid command.<br>
<br>
Basically, if=<br>
you try to use "add hl, ix", you end up with "add ix,<br>
ix".  Same is true =<br>
for "add hl, iy", getting "add iy, iy".  I<br>
couldn't figure out what was wr=<br>
ong with some of my code, and testing<br>
it in a Z80 simulator revealed what =<br>
was going on.  I manually checked<br>
the opcode bytes too to make sure the si=<br>
mulator might not be screwy,<br>
but sure enough, AS80 was generating improper=<br>
instructions in those<br>
two cases.<br>
<br>
Now of course, you can't actually add i=<br>
x to hl, as the datasheet<br>
would indicate, so my code was in error.  But it=<br>
obviously should<br>
have errored out instead of continuing on, and using a d=<br>
ifferent<br>
instruction even.<br>
<br>
I tried this both in versions 1.11 (found he=<br>
re in the Files section),<br>
and 1.41 (the newest on his site), same thing.  =<br>
So I contacted the<br>
author about it, and he said he'd fix it.  But I figure=<br>
d I'd point it<br>
out for anyone else here using that one, in case they might=<br>
make the<br>
same mistake I did.<br>
<br>
Speaking of bugs, I also found that v1.41 =<br>
is now giving me errors<br>
when including a file of "db" strings (for the fon=<br>
t I'm including<br>
with the code), yet if I assemble the same code with v1.11=<br>
, it works<br>
fine.  So I dunno what's going on there.<br>

<br>
Yeah!<br>
=<br>
<br>
I was trying to imagine just how this kind of mistake could<br>
happen.  I me=<br>
an, does as80 actually have "add hl,ix" in a table<br>
of opcodes???  I'll bet =<br>
it doesn't.<br>
<br>
All of the ix & iy instructions use same opcode as the<br>
corespo=<br>
nding hl instruction, except there is an extra byte<br>
in front that tells cpu=<br>
to use ix or iy instead of hl.<br>
<br>
So, probably when as80 sees an ix anywhere=<br>
in an instruction,<br>
it emits the ix prefix byte, and then converts the ix t=<br>
o hl,<br>
and assembles it as an hl instruction.  But it needs to check<br>
if ix i=<br>
s allowed in that position first!!!<br>
<br>
A "DD" in front means use ix instead o=<br>
f hl, and "FD" means<br>
use iy.  I don't think there are any valid instruction=<br>
s with<br>
both hl and ix, or hl and iy, and I guess that also means you<br>
can't=<br>
have both ix and iy either.  And not all insts that can<br>
use hl can substit=<br>
ute ix (or iy).<br>
<br>
"ex de,hl" is valid, but "ex de,ix" is not.  AS80 does<br>
c=<br>
atch that!  So much for my earlier theory...<br>
<br>
ns 1.11 (found here in the Files section),<br>
ite), same thing.  So I contacted the<br>
fix it.<br>
<br>
That's great!  And it's good to know it is still being maintaine=<br>
d.<br>
<br>
I remember finding a bug in a 6805 assembler that I downloaded<br>
directly=<br>
from Motorola.  I was finding lots of "lost clusters"<br>
on my hard drive, bu=<br>
t I had no idea why.  Windows would crash<br>
for some totally unrelated reason=<br>
, and when it rebooted and<br>
checked the disk, it told me it was finding lost=<br>
clusters.<br>
Most of the time, it was not the program that crashed that<br>
had l=<br>
ost them, or even any program that I used that day.<br>
<br>
Of course, windows wou=<br>
ld crash quite often, and not find any<br>
lost clusters.<br>
<br>
After many frustrati=<br>
ng weeks, a pattern emerged: I had used<br>
the motorola assembler recently.  I=<br>
tested theory by using<br>
chkdsk before and after, and sure enough, EVERY TIM=<br>
E I ran<br>
it, I had lost clusters.<br>
<br>
Oh wow!  I found a bug in Motorola's asse=<br>
mbler!!!  I<br>
called them up (this was a long time ago) and told the<br>
"tech su=<br>
pport" guy.  Turns out they knew about it already.<br>
Turns out they knew abou=<br>
t it for quite a while.  Like 3 or<br>
4 years.  Turns out, they even had docu=<br>
mented it, deep down<br>
in a part of the doc that most people would never nee=<br>
d to read.<br>
<br>
I guess I'll just have to imagine how good it felt to hear<br>
bac=<br>
k that he was gonna fix your bug.  :-)<br>
<br>
(Oh yeah, right around that time Ph=<br>
ilips had a design contest<br>
where you could get their software and chip pro=<br>
grammer for like<br>
$30 bucks.  I haven't used any Motorola parts since.  Are<br>
=<br>
they even in business anymore?)<br>
<br>
yone else here using that one, in case they might make the<br>
I did.<br>
rs<br>
with the code), yet if I assemble the same code with v1.11, it works<br>
e.  So I dunno what's going on there.<br>
<br>
What kind of error?  Does it work if=<br>
you paste the file in,<br>
rather than include it?  Or, is it a difference in =<br>
handling<br>
of the "db" itself?<br>

Sounds like that was back in the pre-Win2=<br>

would actually let you destroy and mess up thi=<br>

you.  These days most everything's all sandboxed (in =<br>
the case of old<br>
DOS apps), or usually only accessable via the Windows API.=<br>
But<br>
luckily people sometimes come up with ways to still interface with<br>

hardware, such as the DLLs to write to I/O ports, letting me talk<br>
directly=<br>
to the parallel port and such.<br>
<br>
There's still a charm about being able to =<br>
still have that level of<br>
hardware control, though, which is why I still ke=<br>
ep Win98, as well as<br>
Linux, on my laptop (and XP for when I actually want =<br>

productively).  I was working on some raw floppy drive cont=<br>
roller<br>
routines in assembly once and was using Win98 to test'em, especiall=<br>
y<br>
since it also let you drop straight into DOS mode.  Though this was<br>

was a cra=<br>

<br>
Yeah there's a level of disappointment to think that you've=<br>
<br>
discovered something only to find out that it was found long before.<br>
Bu=<br>
t in that case, it's even more disappointing to think the company<br>
would si=<br>
t on it that long without bothering to fix it.  Especially<br>
when you pretty=<br>
much need it to use their products!<br>
<br>
=<br>
<br>
Surprisingly so, after what you said.<br>
<br>
work if you paste the file in,<br>
rence in handling<br>
<br>
It pretty much tells me "Redefi=<br>
nition of label" for every label<br>
following the included file.  It didn't u=<br>
sed to do this though; it<br>
wasn't till my main file got bigger that it comp=<br>
lained.  It also<br>
looks kind of odd, writing over some of the output text w=<br>
hen it puts<br>
out these errors.  Like how it'll say stuff like "Reading line=<br>
500"<br>
and whatnot, you know.  It starts spitting the error text out on top=<br>
<br>
of it, instead of under it like a legit error.<br>
<br>
I tried what you mentione=<br>
d though, and strangely enough, it compiled<br>
just fine when the data was ad=<br>
ded into the main file.  I didn't<br>
really have enough info to go on to repo=<br>
rt this one to the fellow,<br>
but I think this might be enough to help him tr=<br>
ack it down to the<br>
'include' option somehow.  I'll let him know the sympto=<br>
ms.  I'm sure<br>
he'll feel overjoyed to be hearing from me yet again.  ;)<br>

In Forth you just execute word after word. Either it's a number and it<br>
goes on the stack, or it's a subroutine and it runs, consuming values<br>
from the stack, possibly putting some back on.<br>
<br>
So a Forth assembler typically has constants that represent the<br>
operands. These end up as values on the stack.<br>

MOV, pops the values pushed by H and L constants, Or's them together<br>
with its base opcode, and appends the resulting instruction byte to<br>
the dictionary.<br>
<br>
Try some random combination of operands that it doesn't expect, and<br>
hilarity ensues. It will put something in the dictionary, probably not<br>
the instruction you expect though...<br>
