There is a big book that is available every year that lists EVERY chip made<br>
by part number,<br>
and who the manufacturer is.  I have a very old one 1980's, I will check in<br>
it, but you<br>
probably need to find somebody that has a new one and look it up.<br>
<br>
Also, the RD at the end means R & D, as in research and development...The<br>
chip may<br>
not be a full production line model yet, or it was just a "modified" version<br>
of another chip<br>
for a specific customer to use ??<br>

It has 1MB of Flash, 128KB of RAM.  240x160 LCD.<br>
<br>
Even though it =<br>
has an FCC ID (DGI-PDA100) it doesn't exist in the database.  DGI is anothe=<br>

I think if we could find the datasheet or information on ANY of t=<br>

<br>
Not only does this possibly indicate =<br>
the Mailstation does have a buzzer pin as I previously assumed, but it show=<br>
s the possible ports to use the onboard serial pins.  But most importantly,=<br>
look at the RTC ports!  They say that version of the CPU uses a TC8521 for=<br>
the RTC.<br>

<br>
A 4-bit Toshiba real-time cl=<br>
ock, which just so happens to have a 1hz and 16hz timer, as well as alarm. =<br>
We know the Mailstation has a 1hz interrupt, but from my deductions, the o=<br>
ther was 64hz.  Then again, since they built this directly into the CPU, th=<br>
ey could have modified the divider, or more likely based on what we've seen=<br>
, run it through a user-changeable divider (port $2F maybe??).<br>
<br>
I found m=<br>
any other 4-bit RTC chips which did have a 64hz alternate timer, and others=<br>
with a 1024hz one (much more divideable), so who knows what they actually =<br>
used in the Mailstation version of the CPU.  All I know is that the port ad=<br>
dresses seem to match up perfectly for the one I linked, compared to the ot=<br>
hers I looked at, so that's a good start.  I want to try accessing that bit=<br>
of ram on pages 2 and 3 of its address space sometime, just to confirm it'=<br>

<br>
Here's a snippet I took from the disassembly before of it setting=<br>
