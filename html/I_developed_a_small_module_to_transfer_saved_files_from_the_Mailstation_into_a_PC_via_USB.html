<br>
Well, the parts a=<br>
re the following:<br>
<br>
1)  TI MSP430 Launchpad tool -- I paid $4.30 and that'=<br>
s<br>
with shipping costs to my door, included in the price.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://est=">(URL)</a><br>
ore.ti.com/MSP-EXP430G2-MSP430-LaunchPad-Value-Line-Development-kit-P2031.a=<br>
spx<br>
<br>
2)  DB25 male connector (had one in a drawer.)<br>
3)  fragment of vec=<br>
tor board.<br>
4)  one 3.9k resistor<br>
5)  eight 10k resistors<br>
6)  one 47k =<br>
resistor<br>
7)  one 560pF<br>
8)  wire, solder, soldering iron, pliers, etc.<br>
<br>
=<br>
The TI MSP430 Launchpad board comes with two cpus.  The<br>
MSP430G2231 and the=<br>
MSP430G2211.  Both are 14 pin devices. It<br>
also comes with a 32kHz crystal,=<br>
2 sets of male and female<br>
10-pin connectors for my vector board as a daugh=<br>
ter card<br>
above it, and a USB cable.<br>
<br>
I could have ordered a 20-pin MSP430 d=<br>
evice and added 6 more<br>
I/O pins to use -- might have been enough to do ever=<br>
ything<br>
with one micro that way.  But I decided that since I still<br>
needed th=<br>
at vector board to mount the DB25 on... that I might<br>
was well just use the =<br>
parts that actually come in the kit. To<br>
get the needed I/O I had to use bot=<br>
h cpus.<br>
<br>
The daughter board cpu has access to the parallel port and<br>
use=<br>
s port 1 (P1) to read in the 8 data bits when strobed.  It<br>
also has two mor=<br>
e I/O pins plus an NMI input.  I use the NMI<br>
as the /STROBE input and trigg=<br>
er on falling edge.  The other<br>
two I/O pins serve as BUSY and ACK.  To comm=<br>
unicate with the<br>
main board's cpu, the BUSY line is copied down via the<br>
con=<br>
nector to one of pins there.  Also, two of the 8 data bus<br>
pins perform doub=<br>
le-duty:  as data from the parallel port<br>
when BUSY is not active and when B=<br>
USY is active, the two cpus<br>
uses two of the 8 lines as CLOCK and DATA to tr=<br>
ansfer the<br>
byte over (that's about all the spare pins on the main board,<br>
as=<br>
it uses P2's pins for the 32kHz xtal and two more for TxD<br>
and RxD into the=<br>
virtual com port into the PC and some for<br>
LEDs and for switches.<br>
<br>
There ar=<br>
e many other interesting details and calculations<br>
involved, but that should=<br>
get the basic idea across.<br>
<br>
Software for both cpus is done and working fin=<br>
e and I've been<br>
shipping files across without difficulty.<br>
<br>
Basically, this =<br>
takes advantage of the heavy lifting already<br>
done by an EXTREMELY cheap dev=<br>
elopment board put out by TI,<br>
adding software, vector board, a connector, a=<br>
nd a few cheap<br>
passives.  The whole project, from initial decision to start=<br>
<br>
until finished and working software and in spare time only,<br>
was a little o=<br>
ver two weeks.  Thought it might be a good idea<br>
on the 13th of May.  Had no=<br>
exact idea at the time how to do<br>
it; only a rough feasibility check given =<br>
I/O pins available<br>
and a few thoughts about how I might go about it.<br>

=<br>
makin=<br>
g more of these things and may as well find good homes&lt;br><br>
for the combined=<br>
devices.&lt;br><br>
They aren't just for old people, with this.  The Mailsta=<br>

is very convenient (AA batteries, light weight, low cost) to&lt;br><br>
u=<br>
se anytime one is sitting at the doctor's office waiting, or&lt;br><br>
anywhere i=<br>
t's likely one has time to kill (on rail transport&lt;br><br>
or a bus, etc) and w=<br>
ould like to write with the idea that if&lt;br><br>
the device is lost or stolen i=<br>
t's not several hundreds of&lt;br><br>
dollars of loss.&lt;br><br>
The Kindle is gre=<br>
at for reading.  But it is useless if you&lt;br><br>
want to produce writing conte=<br>
nt, for example..&lt;br><br>
Anyway, I'm going to start producing a finished =<br>
product for&lt;br><br>
these and collecting up those units people want to dispose =<br>
of&lt;br><br>
for whatever reasons.  Probably not to sell, so much, as to&lt;br><br>
give=<br>
away as presents for those I think would get some use&lt;br><br>
out of it.&lt;br><br>
br><br>
I purchased some from Office Depot when they were dumping&lt;br><br>
them at $=<br>
5 each.  Crazy good price.  Too bad that supply is&lt;br><br>
gone!&lt;br><br>
I may=<br>
, at some point, go further and design a unit that ties&lt;br><br>
in via the phon=<br>
e connector and lets it think it is dialing&lt;br><br>
Earthlink so that I can fac=<br>
ilitate a two-way transfer between&lt;br><br>
PC and the unit.  Make it look like =<br>
a file system on USB so&lt;br><br>
that files can be dragged and dropped onto (or =<br>
off of) it.&lt;br><br>
But that's for another day.&lt;br><br>
I used this project to=<br>
continue teaching my son more about&lt;br><br>
electronics, embedded software, re=<br>
ading and finding&lt;br><br>
appropriate documentation and using it well, creating=<br>
associated documentation for a final completion, testing and&lt;br><br>
using=<br>
oscilloscopes and other tools, soldering, etc.  It was&lt;br><br>
a great experie=<br>
nce for him (and for me.)&lt;br><br>

That's very nice of you.  I'd love to =<br>

I will find them goo=<br>

another idea to allow transfers both dir=<br>

<br>
Anyway, I'm located near Portland, Oregon.  Let=<br>

you get in terms of sending them by mail.  If it is too much,=<br>

I might just say to keep them.  But hopefully, the post<br>

If you are of a mind to call, feel free.  If you=<br>

your=<br>
number and preferred times.  Otherwise, let me know the<br>
"damage" your post=<br>

<br>
I would use my bank's "bill pay" to send a ban=<br>
