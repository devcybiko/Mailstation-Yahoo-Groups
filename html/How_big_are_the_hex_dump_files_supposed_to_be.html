<p class="formattedBody">I'm going off the notes on <a target="_blank" href="h">(URL)</a>ttp://www.linux-hacker.net Home / Other<br>
I-Appliances / MailStation / MS/Z80 hacking which describe the bank<br>
setup:-<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
There are 4 slots, of 16k each, at #0000, #4000, #8000, & #C000.<br>
Only slot #4000 & slot #8000 have been observed to be swappable, with<br>
codeflash swapping into #4000, and ram into #8000. Also, it seems<br>
everything except the ram uses #4000 slot. (LCD, dataflash, Modem,<br>
caller ID)<br>
<br>
slot #0000 is always codeflash page #00<br>
slot #4000 is codeflash pages #01 to #3f (Or LCD, dataflash, Modem,<br>
caller ID)<br>
slot #8000 is ram pages #1 to #7<br>
slot #C000 is always ram page #00<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
It seems to me that this is logical but I'm willing to accept<br>
corrections. Don't forget that there is a lot of text material in the<br>
roms along with all the graphics which are used, so any 'code' in<br>
there is irrelevant. I may try to write an 'emulator' which runs<br>
through the roms and maps out the actual code used and the calls<br>
made.<br>
<br>
Also, see "U202 - M5M51008-70 ----- 128 kbyte static ram (cpu data)"<br>
which implies that this ram may be bank switched in the C000 space!<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Well, there is real live code above 4000 in the page 0 hex file. It<br>
disassembles fine and doesn't look like data. In fact, I found some code<br>
there which calls the sector erase function I discovered.<br>
<br>
The slots are just chunks of the CPU's address space where blocks of<br>
flash and RAM are mapped in via I/O port accesses. The way the hex files<br>
are broken up is an independent issue. Personally I'd like just to see<br>
the raw 1Meg dump, and then I'd feel better.<br>
<br>
I have what's there all disassembled and I can grep for IO. That's how I<br>
found the flash byte write, sector erase and parallel port I/O.<br>
<br>
Actually, I just looked at the data sheet again, and it seems they just<br>
have a typo. They say on page 4 that there are 32 64K sectors, but it's<br>
a lie. The picture contradicts, as does the math since then we'd have a<br>
2M chip instead of 1M. Okay, I feel better now...<br>
<br>
Service manual type information is probably considered by Cidco as a<br>
trade secret and would likely only be available under NDA, but if it's<br>
out there great. My guess is we're on our own. The port map and memory<br>
map from linux-hacker has been very helpful.<br>
<br>
They are selling these units possibly at break-even or slight loss in<br>
order to get follow on email subscribers. So unless we're ready to<br>
partner with them they probably don't have much incentive to give out<br>
the info.<br>

Could be when you want to swap rom you jump to the ram and call the<br>
routine that swaps rom banks then jump to the rom. You can't really<br>
be 'in' the rom when it switches because of timing. I note there are<br>
routines that jump to 0000 where there are a series of NOP's.<br>
Possibly a delay?<br>
<br>
If most all of the calls and jumps are to 0000 - 7FFF then that would<br>
clinch it. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a little software in<br>
ram here and there for special purposes.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">The first #0F43 bytes of page #01 are copied to RAM at #8000,<br>
then jumped to.<br>
<br>
This is the reflash code.  Since it has to erase the ROM before<br>
loading the new code, it (reflash) can't run from ROM.  So, while<br>
the code may be ORG'ed #8000, the rom holding that code is<br>
mapped into the #4000-7FFF slot.<br>
<br>
The rest of page #01 is ORG'ed to the #4000 slot.  (At #4F44,<br>
it is re-ORG'ed to #4F44.)<br>
<br>
The code that copies reflash to RAM, then jumps to that copy,<br>
is at #1BC0.<br>
<br>
The call to #1BC0 is in page #03 (which just happens to also be<br>
mapped to the #4000-7FFF slot.  IOW, page #03 in slot #4000<br>
makes a call to #1BC0 in page #00, which swaps page #01 into<br>
slot #4000, copies part of it to RAM in slot #8000, then jumps to<br>
that ram.  One of the first things this code running from RAM<br>
does, is erase the codeflash chip.<br>
<br>
The SECTORS that it erases are 64K, or 4 pages each.<br>
There IS at least one typo in the Fujitsu data sheet.  Under the<br>
heading "FLEXIBLE SECTOR-ERASE ARCHITECTURE", it says<br>
"Thirty two 64 K byte sectors".  There are just sixteen 64 Kbyte<br>
sectors.  16 x 64k x 8 bits = 8 Megabits, and the 29F080 is<br>
an eight megabit chip.<br>
<br>
You can split the files up any way you find convenient (the rom<br>
is really just a 1 Megabyte block of data).  I think that for<br>
disassembly, 16k files are best.<br>
<br>
There are two pages in each of the 32 hex-dump files, where a<br>
page is defined as the chunks that are bank-switched.<br>
<br>
Also, the RAM is eight pages of 16 kBytes each.<br>
(8 x 16kBytes = 128 kBytes)<br>

But surely you should treat it as 64 * 32K where the lower 16K is the<br>
page000 section in each case?<br>
<br>
<br>
Which means that for disassembly you need an "ORG 4000h" at the start<br>
and again half way through? I found it easier to deal with in 16K<br>
sections.<br>

<p class="formattedBody"><br>
You are right, you can't switch the bank you are currently executing<br>
code from.  But you can switch the others.  Rom page #00, which is<br>
always located in slot #0000 (#0000-3FFF) has the routines that<br>
handle the bank-switching for slot #4000 (#4000-7FFF), and also<br>
for slot #8000 (#8000-BFFF).<br>
<br>
The difficulty with bank switching is that it takes two instructions<br>
minimum to jump to a page that is not already banked in.  One<br>
to select the new page, and another to jump (or call) to it.  If you<br>
try to switch the page you are currently executing from, and you set<br>
the page register with a new page number, the CPU is whisked<br>
away to the new page before it can fetch the jump instuction from<br>
the old page.<br>
<br>
The mailstation handles this by making any inter-page calls to<br>
pages #01 thru #3F (in slot #4000) indirectly, going through<br>
fixed page #00 (in slot #0000).  Code in page #00 handles<br>
saving the old page number for slot #4000, setting the new page<br>
number, calling the routine in the new page, and on return<br>
restoring the old page number.<br>
<br>
There is a routine at #19AE, with parameters DE=newpage,<br>
and HL=address_in_that_page, that handles this.  There is<br>
also a set of what might be called "page jumps", starting at #003C,<br>
that load DE with a page number, and then jump to #19AE.  You can<br>
think of these as "worm holes" to the higher pages, where HL<br>
holds the address you want to be at on the other side.<br>
<br>
Also, starting at #059F there is a really long jump table.<br>
Some of the routines that this table jumps to are in page #00,<br>
and there is just a regular jump to the actual routine.  But<br>
most of the routines are in other pages, so there is a<br>
"LD HL,nnnn" and then a jump through one of page-jump<br>
worm holes.<br>
<br>
From the calling routines perspective (slot #4000), a call to this<br>
jump table is just a call to a routine located in slot #0000,<br>
even though the actual code will run from slot #4000.<br>
<br>
There is also a second bank switch routine, that is almost<br>
the same as the one at #19AE.  This one is at #1952, and it<br>
takes it's page & address parameters on the stack.  This one<br>
has an entry in the above mentioned "really long jump table",<br>
at #05ED.  To call an arbitrary page via this method, you<br>
just push the page number and the address on the stack,<br>
after pushing any other params the called routine needs,<br>
and then "CALL #05ED".  I don't know why there are two<br>
ways to do it.<br>
<br>
There are other routines in page #00/slot #0000 that access<br>
the  dataflash, LCD, and modem, by swapping them into<br>
slot #4000, and the ram using slot #8000.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, that is a bit of a mystery why the code doesn't start<br>
right at #0000.  The z80 "restart's" vector to this space,<br>
could be that they left it open in case they ever wanted to use<br>
them???<br>

The data lines are, and I think the control bits are too.  Don't know about<br>
the status bits.  I have seen no evidence of the mailstation using<br>
a serial port, but if you meant writing new code to bit bang it,<br>
sure.  For rs232, you might need to clip the voltages to protect<br>
the cpu.<br>

Yes.<br>
<br>
I think I see where the confusion comes from.  I hadn't noticed that the hex<br>
files were named "page00.hex" etc.<br>
<br>
The mailstation switchable "slots" are 16k each, and the "pages" that<br>
are switched in/out of those slots are 16k each.  Since virtually<br>
nothing was known about the inards of the mailstation when the<br>
dump was made (almost 3 years ago???) you should not infer any<br>
meaning from the sizes/filenames, except the order that the files<br>
map to the rom.<br>
<br>
Once again, each of the hex files contains two of the switchable<br>
pages.  (just making sure we are all on the same "page".)   :^)<br>

That would make sense. You have 128K of battery backed banked ram to<br>
work with and so you can consider the 512K flash rom to be a solid<br>
state disk drive. I gather from other linx hacker comments that the<br>
"sector size" for this rom is 2K but perhaps they map in 16K blocks<br>
to work with.<br>
<br>
could<br>
know about<br>
<br>
I see strings in the rom like "38400192009600..." which I suspect are<br>
for some display purpose and not just modem strings to process.<br>

Right (yes, I've been wrong before...)?<br>
<br>
And even then the real age of a sector I'd think would be how many times<br>
it has been erased (you don't erase a sector every time you write to<br>
it).<br>
<br>
I wonder if that custom Z80 has a UART, even if unused? Microcontrollers<br>
often have built in serial ports.<br>

Sounds reasonable.<br>

Could be. If we can provide a real or simulated serial port we could<br>
connect the machine to other computers, maybe even to a PDD 1 or 2.<br>

I guess maybe cached was not the right word.  What I meant was<br>
more like a ramdisk, where files would only write through to flash<br>
if the ramdisk was full, or on powerdown.<br>
<br>
That way, when you download, read, then delete a message, it<br>
might never touch the flash.  I'm not saying this is likely,<br>
just a possibility.<br>
<br>
The ram is powered, whenever the powerpak is plugged in, or<br>
batteries are installed.  And it seems to make a difference to the<br>
mailstation if it is turned off with the power button, or the cord<br>
pulled.  When shut off properly, it comes back on right to the<br>
main menu.  But if you pull the power cord while it is on, it says<br>
"scanning memory", and goes to a "reset system data" menu.<br>
