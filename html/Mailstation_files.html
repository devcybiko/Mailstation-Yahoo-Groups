<p class="formattedBody">Some of this is based on guesses, and any of it may<br>
turn out to be wrong.<br>
<br>
=<br>
Some of this is pasted in from text that is prolly<br>
too wide.  If you are re=<br>
ading it on group website,<br>
you can select "use fixed width font" over there=<br>
and it might look a little better.<br>
<br>
Dataflash files are accessed by a "file number".<br>
<br>
(The number of =<br>
question-marks is an indicator of how wild<br>
a guess is.  Normal educated gu=<br>
esses usually get 3.)<br>

...<br>
1D - unused???  (not sure what highest possible file# is, need to te=<br>
st)<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure they go up to at least 0x1d or 0x1e, but need<br>
to t=<br>
est to be sure.  There are also file numbers, offset from<br>
actual file numb=<br>
ers by 0x20 or 0x40 (I forget exactly) that<br>
are part of the actual file, (=<br>
or part of the directory,<br>
depending on how you see things).<br>
<br>
I can't find =<br>
it written anywhere, and I forget exactly how it<br>
works, but I seem to reca=<br>
ll thinking the higher numbers may be<br>
a "thread" thru the actual records, =<br>
in a sorted order.<br>
IIRC, At least one file also had a second sort order, =<br>
using<br>
a file number an additional offset higher (+0x80???).<br>
<br>
I do believ=<br>
e the higher numbers are just for internal usage,<br>
and you don't ever "open=<br>
" one of them, you just use the lower<br>
set of file numbers.<br>
(I could be wro=<br>
ng on that, though!)<br>
<br>
(I prolly understood this a lot better 2 or 3 years =<br>
ago!!!)<br>
<br>
I have a vague notion that I saw a place where code was<br>
deleting=<br>
a user, and copying the files of higher users<br>
down 1, to close the gap.  =<br>
IIRC, it was copying 4 different<br>
groups, but I never figured out what the 4=<br>
th group was<br>
(in/out/sent/???).<br>
But it is possible it was just 3 groups.=<br>
<br>
There is more info on files below, in "notes" section.<br>
There is a part =<br>
of dataflash I called "bookmarks", but it<br>
might be better called a "direct=<br>
ory".  The bookmark sector<br>
holds a table of 4 byte dataflash addresses for=<br>
the possible<br>
file numbers.  Each file number has 2 entries (iow, 8 bytes)=<br>
,<br>
I believe the difference is the sort order of that files records.<br>
<br>
I am =<br>
really stretching my memory to the limit, but I seem to<br>
think the bookmarks=<br>
point to a linked list of records with<br>
the file numbers offset as refered =<br>
to earlier.  I believe<br>
these are sorted, and each node points to a message=<br>
record,<br>
in addition to a "next" pointer record.  The message records<br>
hav=<br>
e the actual file number (less than 0x20 iirc), and each<br>
message record ho=<br>
lds a single email message.  I want to say<br>
that there is only one record o=<br>
f pointers for each file, but<br>
I am not sure.  It is possible that each "no=<br>
de" in sorted<br>
list is a separate record.  I don't recall if these have<br>
th=<br>
e same header as the message records.<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure that each message =<br>
in a file has a separate<br>
record, with a 4 byte header.<br>
<br>
Most files (or may=<br>
be I really mean "records" of files)<br>
start with 0xFD if valid, and 0xFC (ii=<br>
rc) if deleted.<br>
The 2nd byte is file number, 3rd & 4th (word) are the size=<br>
<br>
of the data that follows this 4 byte header.<br>
<br>
There are 4 of what I ca=<br>
lled "special files" that use<br>
completely different file structure, with a =<br>
fixed<br>
position in df, and a fixed number of records:<br>
<br>
A0 - user accounts=<br>
<br>
A1 - settings data<br>
A2 - ???<br>
A3 - ???<br>
<br>
Some of the lower number fil=<br>
es (0x02 & 0x03????) have<br>
patches to the file handling code.  This possibl=<br>
y has something<br>
to do with the sorting?????  There are also patches to han=<br>
dle<br>
the "special" files differently.<br>
<br>
I believe you can open/read/write/etc=<br>
*any* of the dataflash<br>
files with the same functions (see my "mailstation=<br>
.h" in<br>
groups file section).<br>
<br>
There is also info in that header regardin=<br>
g structure of the<br>
data portion of the "message" files (inboxes/outboxes/se=<br>
ntboxes).<br>
<br>
The mailstation firmware also has another concept of "files",<br>
wi=<br>
th completely different functions used to access them.<br>
the "ramdisk" functi=<br>
ons.  More than 1 of the ram pages is<br>
dedicated to this ramdisk, I forget =<br>
if it is 2, 3, or maybe 4????<br>
<br>
It is entirely possible that file 0x00 & 0x0=<br>
1 in list above<br>
are not accessed by the dataflash access functions.<br>
(ok, I =<br>
just removed these two from list)<br>
<br>
00 - string table???? (maybe ramdisk, =<br>
and no df file 00?????  if so, then likewise for 01.)<br>
01 - widget "sets"=<br>
(one looks like new acct entry screen, one might be sent screen???)<br>
<br>
They=<br>
might really be "ramdisk" type files????<br>
The more I think, the more like=<br>
ly that seems.<br>
I do remember thinking that it seemed they purposely<br>
did =<br>
not use the same filenumbers for both types of<br>
file, but I see no reason w=<br>
hy you could not have one of<br>
each for a given number.<br>
It may be that they =<br>
developed on a system with normal disk<br>
files, and then mapped some to dataf=<br>
lash, and others to<br>
ram/rom-disk??????????????<br>
<br>
The ramdisk functions are =<br>
more like normal file access functions,<br>
there is even a "seek" function ava=<br>
ilable.<br>
<br>
The ms seems to use these for storing various data<br>
relating to the=<br>
"widgets", iow the widget value is<br>
the file data (IIRC, this includes text=<br>
in text<br>
widgets.<br>
<br>
I think two files (00 & 01) accessed by what I called<br>
"=<br>
ramdisk" functions are actually accessing fixed data in<br>
the  codeflash.  C=<br>
all them "romdisk" maybe???<br>
No, that is not good, there is a function I lab=<br>
eled<br>
"romdisk" that is something entirely different (perhaps<br>
to access th=<br>
at huge chunk of codeflash with the<br>
spellcheck dictionary????????)<br>
<br>
<br>
My approach to making a file system for cp/m wo=<br>
uld leave all<br>
this to the ms firmware, and just call the read/write functio=<br>
ns.<br>
I have thought of various schemes, including using one of the<br>
"users" i=<br>
nboxes, where each "message" was a file.  One interesting<br>
aspect of that wo=<br>
uld be possibility of just "emailing" a file<br>
to the ms!<br>
<br>
Or you could make =<br>
each record in a ms file be a "track" to cp/m.<br>

note 0: Some of thes notes are redundant.  They may have been writ=<br>
ten<br>
months or years apart, and I don't have time to edit right<br>
=<br>
now.  The "note #" has very little to do with the order<br>
they we=<br>
re written.<br>
<br>
note 1: These are optional customized splash screen & logo im=<br>
age data.  The<br>
sizes are how many bytes get copied to ram when thi=<br>
s file is used.<br>
If first two bytes are not "OK", then hardcoded im=<br>
ages in codeflash<br>
are used.<br>
<br>
the first 4 words of the s=<br>
plash file are "5083, 4, 319, 127" or<br>
in hex "#13db, #0004, #013f,=<br>
#007f".  The rest is bit data???<br>
The 319 is x dimension, and 127 =<br>
is y, in pixels.<br>
I don't think you can change the dimensions, coz =<br>
prog expects these<br>
sizes.  The splash is a full screenful, and the=<br>
logo is the size of<br>
the "Mailstation" logo at the top of the main=<br>
menu (iow, it *is*<br>
the main menu logo).<br>
<br>
note 2: I called these=<br>
sectors "bookmarks" for lack of better idea.<br>
There are 2 kinds =<br>
of bookmark sector, and there is always just one<br>
of each kind.  A =<br>
value in the 2nd to last sector specs which of<br>
5 different pairs o=<br>
f sectors are the current bookmarks.  After<br>
a bookmark has been er=<br>
ased 10,000 times, the next pair is used.<br>
After all 5 pairs have b=<br>
een used, it starts over with the first pair.<br>
<br>
The first bookmark =<br>
sector of the pair holds the start addresses for<br>
each of the "norm=<br>
al" files, and also a use count.<br>
<br>
The second of the pair just hold=<br>
s the address of the next free<br>
location in dataflash, and a use co=<br>
unt.<br>
<br>
All the values in the bookmark sectors are 4 bytes long.  =<br>
<br>
The "free" pointer is the 1st 4 bytes of the "free bookmark" sec=<br>
tor,<br>
and the 2nd 4 bytes are a count of how many times this sector=<br>
<br>
has been erased.<br>
<br>
The "file bookmarks" are offset in tha=<br>
t sector by 8 x the file<br>
number.  There are two pointers for each =<br>
file, and I think the<br>
difference may be that they point to 2 diffe=<br>
rent threads thru the<br>
same file (unsorted, and sorted?????).  The =<br>
last 4 bytes in the<br>
sector are the erase count.<br>
<br>
note 3: What I am=<br>
calling bookmarks are pointers to the "normal" files<br>
(and free sp=<br>
ace).  There are five bookmark<br>
sectors.  A byte in second to last =<br>
sector selects which of the<br>
five is currently in use.  The first 4=<br>
bytes<br>
are the dataflash address of next free dataflash sector.<br>
=<br>
The second 4 bytes are a "use count" for this<br>
particular =<br>
bookmark.  When use count reaches 10,000 the next<br>
bookmark sector =<br>
is used.  After all 5 bookmarks<br>
have been used 10,000 times, it st=<br>
art over with the first bookmark.<br>
The bookmark sector is written w=<br>
henever<br>
one of the "normal files" is modified, so it would see a l=<br>
ot<br>
more wear than any other sector.  I don't like<br>
this me=<br>
chanism, but wear leveling is a tricky problem, and this is better than not=<br>
hing.<br>
(08:02:xx) might be a bookmark also???  erased along with ot=<br>
her 5.<br>
<br>
note 4: I called this "magic_sector" just because I didn't know wh=<br>
at it was<br>
for.  Turns out it is a sort of directory for the loaded=<br>
apps.<br>
<br>
note 6: the first 4 words of the splash file are "5083, 4, 319, 12=<br>
7" or<br>
in hex "#13db, #0004, #013f, #007f".  The rest is bit data??=<br>
?<br>
The larger one is full screenful, other is smaller, probably<br>
=<br>
the size of the cidco logo?????<br>
