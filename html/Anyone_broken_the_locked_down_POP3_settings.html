<p class="formattedBody">I thought everyone had given up on this.  I see it's not the case.<br>
<br>
Has anyone been able to change the server settings from Earthlink?  I've<br>
still got 2 brand new units here.  I was going to take one and toy around<br>
with the idea of spoofing their IP inside my own DNS and creating my own<br>
dialup port.  With WiFi being "everywhere" around Atlanta it's not really<br>
worth the trouble anymore though.<br>
<br>
I had tried back when these were "free" to get a womens shelter to get them.<br>
They said they were only accepting PII or better machines for donation and<br>
they "preferred laptops".  Well La De Dah!  I never thought I'd see the day<br>
you could not give away a free machine!<br>
<br>
Good luck, good hacking!<br>

I am interested in running alternative firmware on the thing... say with<br>
ZCN or maybe a hacked up TRS-80 Model 100 ROM, or a make it a<br>

<br>
In fact interfacing to the outside world is a challenge on the<br>
mailstation. It's highest speed interface is its parallel port.<br>
<br>
Once we have alternative firmware, I think a MailStation will be every<br>
bit as useful as the various smart keyboards that are around. Only thing<br>
that would make it much better is if it had a USB port.<br>
<br>
CJ has already done the heavy lifting by reverse engineering the code<br>
enough to produce a tool which can program the flash over the parallel<br>
port.<br>
<br>
Unforunately I don't know much about using the existing firmware. There<br>
are various notes over at linux-hacker which you've probably already<br>
found.<br>

Just wanted to let everyone know that the �Function +<br>
D + Reset� is only for Restoring the default account.<br>
The default account is the<br>
@.... this is handy if you<br>
are giving a mailstation away and don�t want to leave<br>
any information (e-mails, settings, or address book<br>
information) in the unit.<br>
<br>
I know the "Function + Shift + T + Power On" should<br>
work for putting your own settings in. When you use<br>
"Function + Shift + T + Power On" that should leave<br>
you at the �Diagnostic Menu�. First you need to do the<br>
�Fast Test�, this should be option number 2. This will<br>
test �Flash, Key, Printer Port, RAM and ROM�, after<br>
that screen it will go to the �Battery TESTING�<br>
screen. You then need to hit the �Enter� key twice,<br>
this will drop you back to the �Diagnostic� Menu, now<br>
hit �Q� for quit. You should see the �Test Over!�<br>
message, then it will dump you out at the standard<br>
reset menu, just hit �No Clear� and if all went well<br>
you should see a prompt like �Please create a new user<br>
account�. Just hit OK and slap you info in to the<br>
unit.<br>
<br>
Also I was able to find some interesting information<br>
on the XTND commands. The XTND commands are used in<br>
configuration of the mailstation. When a configuration<br>
is generated the key code is also created verifying<br>
that it�s a real configuration. The unit will then<br>
take all the configuration information and configure<br>
its-self.<br>
<br>
From what i have gathered there are 2 parts to the<br>
mailstation service. First you have your standard POP3<br>
Mailbox and they have a Mail Proxy that sits over it.<br>
The Mail Proxy chops up long e-mails and strips out<br>
some advertisements that would normally cause the mail<br>
not to come though. I don�t know what method the proxy<br>
uses to figure what parts to strip but if anyone has<br>
idea please let me know.<br>
<br>
|-------| |-----| |-------|<br>
|POP3 |&lt;->|PROXY|&lt;--|MAIL |<br>
|Mailbox| | | |STATION|<br>
|-------| |-----| |-------|<br>
<br>
Anyways this leaves me with several questions about<br>
the key code. I�m thinking that the Mail Proxy<br>
verifies the key and sends all the configuration<br>
information to the mailstation. I have tried to<br>
simulate configuration messages but to no avail.<br>
Anyone else working in this direction?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">aahhh I see. Well, I can understand wanting to stay<br>
out of legal/DMCA issues. Well I guess we will have to<br>
look at something else. I for one dont want to get in<br>
trouble over a mailstation. Well I'm going to do some<br>
more thinking, and see what I can figure out. I'll<br>
keep you posted.<br>
<br>
It seems the parallel flash is going to be the best<br>
bet to do anything with the mailstation :)<br>
<br>
Oh well, just a though....<br>
<br>
<br>
I've looked at the possibility of breaking the key<br>
code, but this could be dangerous in light of the<br>
DMCA.<br>
<br>
The method of sending updates to a Mailstation is<br>
covered by US Patent 6,697,942.  The "security key" is<br>
discussed in this patent, and the patent mentions<br>
"Simple DES" cyphers.  I'm no expert in cryptography,<br>
so I wouldn't know how to go about generating a valid<br>
key, and even if I did, there's no guarantee that the<br>
method described in the patent is the method used.<br>
<br>
Any attempt to circumvent the security process could<br>
result in legal issues. This is why I haven't looked<br>
into this area very closely. I've created and sent<br>
messages to my Mailstation without a security key and<br>
have had no luck in updating anything. It seems that<br>
the security key verifies that the message is legit,<br>
and without it you're going to have no luck in<br>
changing any settings.<br>
<br>
Another member is exploring the possibility of<br>
changing the contents of the on-board flash through<br>
the parallel port built in to the machine. I think<br>
there's more possibility of success using that<br>
approach, but it requires extra equipment that I don't<br>
have right now.<br>
<br>
The processor is a Z80-derivative, so information is<br>
readily available on the Web. The problem is that<br>
there could be several megabytes of code to wade<br>
through to find the code that verifies the key, and it<br>
may not be easy to recognize when you see it. I'm not<br>
saying it's impossible; it's just not your typical<br>
weekend project. I'm sure it's only a matter of time<br>
before someone isolates that code and finds a way<br>
around it.<br>
