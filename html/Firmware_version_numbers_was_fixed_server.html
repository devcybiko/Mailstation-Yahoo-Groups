rstand.<br>
ich they say POP3 and SMPT Server.<br>
+T keys,<br>
Server follow fixed there,<br>
<br>
I have models with firmware ver=<br>
sions 2.22R, 2.52R and 2.53YR,<br>
and they do *not* allow you to set the pop3 =<br>
or the smtp<br>
server fields (even with the sh-fn-T flash test method).<br>
<br>
I als=<br>
o have models with higher firmware versions, such as<br>
2.54Y, 2.55Y, 3.03a, 4=<br>
.03M, 4.04B, 4.04E, 4.05D, and 4.05E,<br>
and I am pretty sure that all of thos=<br>
e can be set to any<br>
server, using the various methods listed elsewhere.<br>
<br>
My=<br>
guess is that the "R" means that the server is "restricted",<br>
(or some othe=<br>
r word that starts with R and means similar thing). :-)<br>
<br>
Since i'm on subje=<br>
ct of firmware version numbers, it doesen't<br>
seem to big a stretch that the=<br>
"Y" stands for the "Yahoo" tie in.<br>
<br>
Making some wilder guesses, the 4.04M =<br>
is a Mivo 200.<br>
3.03a is the revised 3.03, with "new color" (ivory as oppose=<br>
d<br>
to brown).<br>
<br>
4.04B might be a revision of the 4.04 (if there even is a 4.=<br>
04<br>
or 4.04A), or else it might just mean "blue case".<br>
<br>
Wilder still guesse=<br>
s, perhaps the "D" and "E" stand for domestic<br>
and export??????????<br>
<br>
If anyo=<br>
ne has any firmware versions that are not in the table<br>
in the database area=<br>
of group, feel free to add yours!<br>

Wel=<br>
l, that didn't work too good.  It was supposed to be a link to<br>
the table, t=<br>
hat was sorted on the firmware version field.<br>
<br>
If you manage to find it any=<br>
way, and you sort on that field, it<br>
will put them in roughly chronological =<br>
order.  Except for the<br>
1.xx versions (250 & 350) which I think came out som=<br>
ewhere<br>
between the 2.xx and 4.xx.  I don't have any idea why they are<br>
not i=<br>
n sequence with others.<br>
