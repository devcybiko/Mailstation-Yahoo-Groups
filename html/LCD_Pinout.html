This info is for the LCD in the white mailstation,<br>
I think it is the same in all models except 300 & 350.<br>
<br>
The display is 320 x 128 x 1, but it is really two 160 x 128<br>
displays side by side.  Pins 7 & 10 select which half.<br>
<br>
Each half has 20 columns, each column is 8 pix wide, and 128 pix high.<br>
<br>
Data is written as if the lcd was a ram.  First the column address is<br>
written to address #38 while the column reg is selected (pin 8 low).<br>
Then the pixel data for the 128 rows is written, one byte per row, to<br>
addresses #38 thru #B7 (while pin 8 is held high).<br>
<br>
My guess as to why the rows are numbered #38 thru #B7 is that<br>
the controller IC inside the LCD can address more than 128<br>
rows, and these were just the most convenient pins to use.<br>
<br>
IIRC, the first half is on the left, col 0 is on the right of<br>
each half, row #38 at the top, and d0 at the left of each byte,<br>
but you might want to check that.<br>
<br>
Contrast is controlled with a variable resistor (10k pot with<br>
wiper shorted to one end) from pin2 to GND.<br>

It might not be obvious, but the connector on the main board is a zif.<br>
While it is not difficult to pull the cable out without opening,<br>
it is rather difficult to get it back in!   :^)<br>
<br>
Just use two thumbnails on the ears at either end to pop it open.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  I don't have data sheets, I used a meter, and looked at<br>
the code.  Some of this is from memory, and any of it may be wrong.<br>
No animals were harmed in compiling this data.<br>
(But a few mailstations were.)<br>
