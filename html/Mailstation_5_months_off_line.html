You have to remember that the Earthlink call center is in INDIA, and so are<br>
the first level<br>
techs and call takers.  Most of these do not have the expertise to call your<br>
relative<br>
and walk them through what is needed to set this up.<br>
<br>
Best thing to do is get the unit back at your location, find a local or 800<br>
number that<br>
the unit can call from Toronto, and then call Earthlink yourself and walk<br>
them through<br>
it to get it set up.  After YOU have it working to your satisfaction, then<br>
send it back to<br>
Florida !!! (Make sure the old unit is NOT hooked up and working during this<br>
time, or it<br>
will mess things up)<br>
<br>
This may be a little more work and hassle, but in the long run you will get<br>
it running to<br>
your satisfaction.<br>
<br>
You will use the same email address, DSN address from both Toronto and<br>
Florida.<br>
Just might temporarily have to use a different dial up number to set it up<br>
and then<br>
change that number for something that would work from Florida.<br>
All you really need them to do is authorize it for a new unit serial number.<br>
They will<br>
send a message to the old unit to turn off and a message to the new unit to<br>
switch<br>
the serial number address to your email address.<br>
<br>
Good luck !!<br>

When my mum goes back South, I expect the=<br>

respond.<br>
At each new location she plugs her machine into, she needs to put=<br>

in to get 'On Line' again.<br>
Anyone have an actual addr=<br>

I don't think a mailstation can work with these new type servers - I'd try<br>

you can't do any funny login protocols.<br>

You have to remember that the Earthlink call center is in INDIA, and<br>
so are the first level<br>
techs and call takers.  Most of these do not have the expertise to<br>
call your relative<br>
and walk them through what is needed to set this up.<br>
<br>
Best thing to do is get the unit back at your location, find a local<br>
or 800 number that<br>
the unit can call from Toronto, and then call Earthlink yourself and<br>
walk them through<br>
it to get it set up.  After YOU have it working to your satisfaction,<br>
then send it back to<br>
Florida !!! (Make sure the old unit is NOT hooked up and working<br>
during this time, or it<br>
will mess things up)<br>
<br>
This may be a little more work and hassle, but in the long run you<br>
will get it running to<br>
your satisfaction.<br>
<br>
You will use the same email address, DSN address from both Toronto<br>
and Florida.<br>
Just might temporarily have to use a different dial up number to set<br>
it up and then<br>
change that number for something that would work from Florida.<br>
All you really need them to do is authorize it for a new unit serial<br>
number.  They will<br>
send a message to the old unit to turn off and a message to the new<br>
unit to switch<br>
the serial number address to your email address.<br>
<br>
Good luck !!<br>

I'm hoping to get some assistance. I bought my mother a Mailstation 6<br>
some years ago and it<br>
went dim this summer. I picked up a replacement on eBay and shipped<br>
it down (Florida). I<br>
can't seem to get Earthlink to call her to 'Walk her' through the<br>
programming on the<br>
replacement despite several attempts.<br>
<br>
If this doesn't work would hacking it be a viable 'plan B' to put it<br>
onto another more reliable<br>
and professional ISP. I've a few in mind at this point.<br>
<br>
Someone here able to help me? I'm in Toronto and the unit is in Florida.<br>
