<p class="formattedBody">I just aquired a mailstation with the following markings:<br>
<br>
Body color: black<br>
Markings: CIDCO MODEL DET1<br>
Function-Shift-T-(Power ON) brings up Diagnostic Main Menu<br>
Version: 2.55Y<br>
<br>
After I quit the diagnostic menu I get a "Reset System Data" menu.<br>
After I reset all of the systems data I can create a new user.<br>
All fields are blank including the POP3/SMTP lines.<br>
<br>
My questions are:<br>
Can I use this to call into my home linux server and get my mail that<br>
way. Also, has anyone created a small linux to run on the mailstation<br>
and become a small terminal, etc...?<br>

All of this is covered on linux-hacker.net .<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes. See linux-hacker.net in the mailstation section<br>
<br>
<br>
No. The effort on this list is to reverse engineer the device and flash<br>
a new image to it such that some other OS could eventually be run.<br>
<br>
Linux will not run on a Z80. No MMU, virtual memory, etc. uCLinux,<br>
maybe. A better OS for this device is CP/M, which makes a perfectly good<br>
terminal, word processor, and can run various compilers (an example of a<br>
nice CP/M laptop is the Amstrad NC100 or NC200 running ZCN). We're<br>
talking an 8-bit CPU here. The best thing to do is either have no OS, or<br>
an OS that was optimized for 8-bit devices and their constraints.<br>
