<p class="formattedBody">My mother had mailstation several years ago but stopped it.  She<br>
wishes to restart it however in doing searching on the net I don't<br>
find much - I get sent to earthlink who apparently now operates<br>
it.  The monthly cost for an earthlink account is over $20.  Does<br>
earthlink still support mailstation and if so what is the monthly<br>
charge.  Don't want to go the computer route for her as mailstation<br>
is confusing enough.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<p class="formattedBody">It's possible it may be able to use another ISP - possibly a free one. What<br>
exact model and ROM does it have?<br>
<br>
See the files in our files section.<br>
<br>
BTW, I suspect that EarthStation will bail out on this system in the near<br>
future.<br>

I don't know how much longer Earthlink will continue to support it, but<br>
the Mailstation can be used with other Internet Service Providers<br>
(ISP).  There are instructions on changing its settings in the files<br>
sections of this group.<br>
<br>
You might want to look into low-cost ISP in your area, or perhaps even<br>
a local small-business ISP.  While $20 per month is pretty standard,<br>
there are a few places offering dial-up access for about $10 per month,<br>
including an email mailbox, which the Mailstation can access.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>
