I was led to understand that there was an active and moderated<br>
project to hack these devices, but have seen no posts here (about<br>
anything).  "moved home" is an expression I used to suggest that the<br>
project may no longer be hosted here but somewhere else instead.<br>

Thank You for the defi=<br>
nation, never heard it said that way before.<br>
<br>
This is one "home" for inform=<br>
ation about mailstation.<br>
<br>
The other is: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin=">(URL)</a><br>
/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl<br>
<br>
Scroll down to mailstation.<br>
<br>
But to let you know=<br>
, the "development" of mailstation software stopped<br>
awhile ago.<br>
<br>
There is n=<br>
ot enough information to get anything really done.<br>
<br>
The time required to re=<br>
verse enginner the mailstation has slowed to a<br>
crawl and has now stopped.<br>
<br>
=<br>
So, if you have the time and disere to forge on ahead, please ask any<br>
quest=<br>
ions about what you find here and on the Linux-hacker site.<br>
<br>
Good Luck and =<br>
have fun.<br>
