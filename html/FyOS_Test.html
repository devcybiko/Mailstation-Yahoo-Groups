<p class="formattedBody">This is far from an actual OS just yet, but I made considerable<br>
strides no=<br>
w that I have full I/O in C, and made a pretty decent<br>
command-line interfa=<br>
ce to do some various tasks.  I haven't touched<br>
up the source to everythin=<br>
g just enough yet to release that, but I<br>
thought I'd let folks test the bi=<br>
nary to see if there's anything I<br>
might need to do before I release anythi=<br>
ng else.  Plus I just think<br>
it's kind of neat to play with!<br>
<br>
So let me jus=<br>
t get to the link, first of all:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/fyos_=">(URL)</a><br>
001.bin<br>
<br>
You need a loader app already, which is outside of the scope of th=<br>
is<br>
particular post.  I might write up some documentation on that aspect<br>
a=<br>
nd include a loader app when I release the full source.  But for the<br>
time =<br>
being, this assumes you're using something or other that gets a<br>
binary fil=<br>
e into ram at 0x8000, and executes it.  It also expects to<br>
have interrupts=<br>
enabled when it starts.<br>
<br>
Now I know there's a few different firmware versi=<br>
ons floating around<br>
out there, but one of the neater aspects is that I wro=<br>
te support into<br>
CRT0 initialization to detect the firmware version and dyn=<br>
amically<br>
fill in the shadow vars (I only use p2 and p3 shadow for now).  T=<br>
his<br>
means it SHOULD support v2.53, v2.54, and v3.03 just fine, despite<br>
ea=<br>
ch being different.  But I've only tested it on v3.03, because<br>
that's the =<br>
only MS I have.<br>
<br>
When it loads up, you get some info where it shows the fir=<br>
mware<br>
version, tells you if it's satisfied with that version (and what<br>
fa=<br>
llback it used if not), then shows some other stuff.  One is where<br>
I was t=<br>
esting to verify globals were being initialized, which<br>
probably isn't need=<br>
ed anymore.  The shadow byte addresses should help<br>
you verify if it's usin=<br>
g the proper ones.  And cgafont_addr is just<br>
for reference, and probably i=<br>
sn't really needed anymore either.<br>
<br>
Then you get a > (unfortunately no blin=<br>
king cursor yet), where you<br>
type in commands.  To get a list, use "help". =<br>
Case insensitive.<br>
<br>
You have:<br>
<br>
CLS - Clears the screen.<br>
EXIT - Launches ori=<br>
ginal page4000 loader (in case you want to reload<br>
it or other code, which =<br>
I do often for testing).<br>
HELP - Gets help on individual commands.<br>
HEXTOINT =<br>
- Displays hex strings as integers.  Was used to test a<br>
function I wrote t=<br>
o do this, but I left the command in anyway.<br>
PEEK - Displays memory locatio=<br>
ns in hex.<br>
POKE - Writes a byte to a memory location.<br>
RESET - Resets FyOS t=<br>
o initial screen.<br>
REBOOT - Resets the Mailstation to 0x0000.<br>
POWERDOWN - Tu=<br>
rns off the Mailstation via firmware function 0x0A6B.<br>
<br>
The screen will scro=<br>
ll downwards when you reach the bottom, just like<br>
any other text screen.  =<br>
Text wraps around the right edge.  Backspace<br>
goes past the left edge to th=<br>
e previous line (unless at line 0).  The<br>
text I/O is really pretty nifty i=<br>
f I do say so myself.<br>
<br>
Not all of the code is optimized yet, some of which =<br>
still being<br>
written in C functions.  Some of the assembly could be written=<br>
in a<br>
better manner, as well.  But hey, it works.  I'd rather focus on<br>
fu=<br>
nctionality than speed at the moment.<br>
<br>
I should point out that I am NOT usi=<br>
ng a custom interrupt here.  I'm<br>
not using custom keyboard functions or an=<br>
y of that.  This is working<br>
purely off the Mailstation firmware, which is =<br>
why it was important to<br>
use the proper shadow vars.  To get a blinking cur=<br>
sor though, I may<br>
have to hook the interrupt sometime.<br>
<br>
I can't think of a=<br>
nything else in particular to mention about it, so<br>
I hope it works on othe=<br>
r Mailstations!<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Welp, I finished a whole bunch of documenation, commented my source<br>
files,=<br>
and included the tools I use (short of SDCC itself), all in<br>
one zip file.=<br>
If you have a PC and a Mailstation, then you should be<br>
able to use this =<br>
I hope!<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/fyos_c_002.zip">(URL)</a><br>
<br>
Check out the=<br>
readme.txt first.<br>
<br>
It's actually v0.02 of FyOS included this time, instea=<br>
d of simply the<br>
source to v0.01.  I made a bunch of changes to the code, a=<br>
nd since<br>
the FyOS command interpreter basically makes for a big example of=<br>
how<br>
to use this stuff, I figured it only made sense to go ahead and<br>
incl=<br>
ude the newest.  I included a binary version too if you want to<br>
get right =<br>
to playing with it.<br>
<br>
Version 0.02 has a lot of optimizations (particularly =<br>
in screen<br>
scrolling and clearing), as well as some additional commands, li=<br>
ke to<br>
poke and peek values into ports now (since before you could only do =<br>
<br>
memory locations).  There's also an interactive scancode viewer.<br>
<br>
I includ=<br>
ed the binary to v0.01 too if anyone wants to compare the<br>
two.  This might=<br>
give you an idea of how writing code in C will<br>
perform as opposed to asse=<br>
mbly.  Screen scrolling and clearing is<br>
particularly noticable between the=<br>
two.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it's starting to get pretty fat already!  I'm going t=<br>
o<br>
have to figure out an alternative storage method.  I have some things<br>
i=<br>
n mind though.<br>
<br>
But yeah, FyOS aside, you should be able to just write you=<br>
r own apps<br>
fairly easily now I hope.  There's hardly any difference in wri=<br>
ting<br>
for the Mailstation as to just a normal console window in DOS or<br>
Lin=<br>
ux, to be honest.  printf/getchar/gets are the most used functions<br>
for con=<br>
sole interaction that I know of, and they work fine with no<br>
setup necessar=<br>
y by the user.  Only thing you truly have to worry<br>
about is your code and =<br>
data sizes, since the MS can only hold so much.<br>
<br>
As always, let me know if =<br>
you have any problems or questions.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Not posted here lately, but I've been working nonetheless!  I made a<br>
ton o=<br>
f internal changes, so I went from v0.02 to just making this<br>
v0.1.  The so=<br>
urce is still messy though so I'm only going to release<br>
a binary as a prev=<br>
iew.  It not only needs more comments, but still<br>
needs some work to make i=<br>
t easier to access from outside code.  In<br>
other words, by the time I relea=<br>
se the source next time, it'll likely<br>
have an actual programming interface=<br>
similar to CP/M's BDOS<br>
functionality.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fybertech.net/mailstati=">(URL)</a><br>
on/fyos_01_ldr.bin<br>
<br>
The big internal changes are:<br>
<br>
- Interrupt has been f=<br>
ully replaced.  This means the firmware's<br>
keyboard routines were ripped ou=<br>
t to be loaded from elsewhere, and to<br>
also use variables in different loca=<br>
tions.  This was necessary<br>
because...<br>
<br>
- I added in key repeat.<br>
<br>
- And a=<br>
n actual blinking cursor.<br>
<br>
- Replacing the interrupt meant I was no long=<br>
er tied to using the<br>
firmware's p2shadow and p3shadow.  In other words, th=<br>
is should run on<br>
any version of the firmware, since I'm no longer using an=<br>
y firmware<br>
routines.  And I created my own shadow vars.<br>
<br>
- The entire thi=<br>
ng now runs from the upper 16K of ram.  The command<br>
interpreter starts at =<br>
0xc000, and the "BDOS" starts at 0xe400.  The<br>
command interpreter is prett=<br>
y fat right now, since it's all written<br>
in C.  It was all I could do to ma=<br>
ke it fit in that space, and I had<br>
to remove a couple of the help commands=<br>
to do that!  The "BDOS" is<br>
all assembly.<br>
<br>
Since the code starts at 0xc00=<br>
0 (though initially executed at<br>
0xe400), I tacked it onto the end of a tin=<br>
y loader.  So you can still<br>
load the binary at the normal 0x8000, and once=<br>
it runs, it'll take<br>
care of moving the code into the right place and exec=<br>
uting it.<br>
<br>
I have to say, the addition of a blinking cursor makes it look m=<br>
uch<br>
more alive now than it has nearly the entire time I've worked on all<br>
=<br>
this.  It was certainly worth the effort involved.  For all intents<br>
and pu=<br>
rposes, it's now about as close to a true text console as one<br>
can get.<br>
<br>
I =<br>
don't know how many people actually have tried any of the other<br>
versions, =<br>
but I hope you like this one!  And if you don't know how to<br>
load it, there=<br>
's instructions and software in the v0.02 zip to let<br>
you do so.<br>
<br>
Also, in=<br>
a funny twist, it seems that there's a perfect sequence of<br>
bytes somewher=<br>
e in my code/data which makes the Mailstation think it<br>
was shut down prope=<br>
rly when you hit the reset button on the back.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Hi, a number of times i read that you have storage problems with the<br>
station, maybe my suggestion is not applicable or already<br>
why not use the 8 megabits flash memory that the<br>
e e-mails and CFG files, to store the FS and/<br>
or<br>
ot a HUGE amount of memory but, 1MB is 1MB.<br>
<br>
There were a couple of prob=<br>
lems with using the flash memory.  At<br>
least in my mind.  The codeflash was=<br>
the larger one, and I didn't<br>
really want to mess with it for the time bei=<br>
ng.  Especially since<br>
it's broken up into 64KB sectors, meaning you have t=<br>
o erase the whole<br>
chunk to change anything in it.  The dataflash is only 5=<br>
12KB, but has<br>
256 byte sectors, which is much better for storing data.  Ho=<br>
wever,<br>
they chose to use one with far less write cycles than even the<br>
cod=<br>
eflash.  So after some extended use, you'd eventually start<br>
wearing it dow=<br>
n to the point that it wouldn't work anymore.<br>
<br>
So that leads me to the pr=<br>
oblem of making some sort of file system<br>
out of it that limits how much it=<br>
writes to particular sectors.  For<br>
my little Fonera router thing that I r=<br>
eflashed a while back, it uses<br>
JFFS to deal with the flash memory, to writ=<br>
e to it in kind of a<br>
circular loop, to extend the flash's life as long as =<br>
possible.  But<br>
the problem is that that method is more memory-intensive an=<br>
d slow,<br>
and I think that's the last thing the Mailstation needs to contend=<br>
<br>
with.  The Fonera has much more horsepower to deal with it.<br>
<br>
I considered=<br>
compact flash once (which is nearly identical to IDE),<br>
but that would req=<br>
uire an actual hardware mod, and I've always wanted<br>
to keep this stuff as =<br>
casual hobbyist friendly as possible.  Plus I<br>
didn't particularly want to =<br>
risk the Mailstation itself for modding.<br>
That's why I thought of trying t=<br>
o use SD over the parallel port of<br>
the thing.  That'd be slow, but it woul=<br>
d work.  It's just a matter of<br>
making some little adapter.  Such a thing w=<br>
ould also have to adapt<br>
the 5v to 3.3v.  And I'm lazy and never did it!<br>
<br>
I=<br>
n the end though, it will probably come down to some sort of<br>
internal flas=<br>
h storage.  I'll try to do some reading on what other<br>
people have done wit=<br>
h other devices and see if I can get some idears,<br>
to avoid wearing the fla=<br>
sh down as much as possible.  It's just one<br>
of those things where I'm stil=<br>
l at the stage where it's daunting to<br>
think about.<br>
