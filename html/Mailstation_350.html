What's in those areas now?  The serial number is on a =<br>

What can you do in the hex editor?  Write Z80 machine code?  How do you<br>
execute it?  The memory seems to contain mostly zero bytes except for a<br>
few hundred bytes at the end.<br>

You need to *enable* edit mode after you get in viewer mode.<br>

These are mailstation 350's.........version 1.37 seems to come up in the<br>
"diagnostic" menu, if you<br>
hold down the "Function, Q and A" keys on the keyboard and turn the power on<br>
or RESET the unit.<br>
<br>
Have to hold them down UNTIL the menu comes up !!<br>
<br>
Version 1.39 comes up with a "Login" box, which requires you to type in "QA<br>
???????" relating to the<br>
serial number of the unit.  Then you should get the Diagnostic menu.<br>
<br>
So far, other testing the unit, and clearing the "flash" memory, I can't see<br>
what use this menu is to<br>
getting things re-programmed.<br>
<br>
The unit S/N and SHIPID is located in the lower left of the unit.<br>
<br>
If you test "Flash" or "Clear Flash", then when you re-power it up, all data<br>
is cleared from the<br>
Setup and Network areas.  Problem is that the unit will NOT let you into the<br>
"E-mail Address" on the<br>
Setup screen.  If you hit the "Save" key, then it tells you to enter all<br>
data, and if you press OK,<br>
then it goes directly to the "Email Address" location, but will NOT allow<br>
you to enter anything in it.<br>
<br>
You are effectively locked out from using the unit from there on.<br>
<br>
Even resetting the "Factory settings" by the "Function and D" keys gets you<br>
nowhere. There is NO<br>
factory data in the "Flash" anymore to put back in the unit.<br>
<br>
The ONLY hope is to either find a way to get into a HEX editor on the unit,<br>
or to re-load the info<br>
from the Parallel port via another computer.<br>

Have to hold them down UNTIL the menu comes up !!<br>
<br>
Version 1.39 comes up with a "Login" box, which requires you to type in "QA ???????" relating to the<br>

So far, other testing the unit, and clearing the "flash" memory, I can't see what use this menu is to<br>
getting things re-programmed.<br>
<br>
The unit S/N and SHIPID is located in the lower left of the unit.<br>
<br>
If you test "Flash" or "Clear Flash", then when you re-power it up, all data is cleared from the<br>
Setup and Network areas.  Problem is that the unit will NOT let you into the "E-mail Address" on the<br>

<br>
You are effectively locked out from using the unit from there on.<br>
<br>
Even resetting the "Factory settings" by the "Function and D" keys gets you nowhere. There is NO<br>

Well since you seem to know what is needed here, how do I ask to get another<br>
unit turned on<br>
next time ???<br>
I have another 350 unit, that I want to replace a current model 100 unit<br>
with.<br>
<br>
We tried to do that about 6 months ago, but ran into the same problem, in<br>
the fact that<br>
they could NEVER get it to change over and go to the setup mail account from<br>
it's serial<br>
number account.  It sends mail out OK, so I know it works.<br>
<br>
Up until I put this last 350 in service, I just thought that it was broken<br>
somehow.<br>
But when the other 350 unit would not convert to the mail account also, I<br>
bought a<br>
3rd unit. It did the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
It was not until I raised the fact that I would not pay for a NEW account<br>
that I did not have any<br>
equipment on that worked, that they said that they had to get a SENIOR<br>
Technician to<br>
do something. About 2 hours later, that unit changed it's programming and<br>
set itself<br>
up on the account like it should have.  It is working fine now, (And YES, I<br>
did pay the<br>
account up at that point).<br>
<br>
So what do I have to tell the Phone person to correctly get this other 350<br>
unit setup,<br>
and transferred to my other account that I have the model 100 on ??<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>
<br>
Wayne<br>
<br>
PS, I think the mailstation service is great, especially for those that are<br>
not computer<br>
geeks like us.  The system works great in most cases, except for it's lack<br>
of being<br>
able to view larger emails.  But I have had one for my Mother (age 75)(Model<br>
100)  for several years now,<br>
and She is thrilled with it and I just got one (model 350) for my Aunt and<br>
Uncle (75 years).<br>
The ONLY way that we can get good constant communications with these people.<br>
<br>
If Earthlink decides at some point to discontinue this service in the<br>
future, please advise us<br>
at that time how to change these units for other services !!!  Thanks !!<br>

No thats not the case. The service in mailstation 350 is the same, but the<br>
mailstation itself takes the data differently. its the hardest mailstation<br>
to tech, unlike the other mailstation models which are quite easy.<br>

Well,<br>
Govind C,<br>
Please tell me what I need to tell the person on the Tech phone when I call<br>
them ???<br>
I tried to have this Model 350 changed to my account (from the current model<br>
100), and<br>
it would not change over like the last model 350 unit I setup.   I again<br>
called and they sent the message,<br>
and it would not change over.  I know it works because I can send a message<br>
from it to other<br>
email addresses OK.<br>
<br>
Is there something or somebody I should ask for that knows what is needed to<br>
make it change<br>
over ???  It is a Version 1.38 model 350   serial number is 0239028999<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>

I tried it and it still did not change over, so I did the Hard Reset like<br>
you suggested, and then pulled the<br>
batteries out and did it again.  It still will NOT change over, it connects<br>
OK, logs in to the server,<br>
then says "No Mail", then logs into the "Send mail server", and then says "0<br>
messages sent".<br>
<br>
800 number they gave me is 800-520-3236 ......<br>
<br>
This is a Model 350 version is 1.38<br>
<br>
Is there any way to re-load the "factory defaults" back into it like the<br>
model 100 does.<br>
Maybe there is something glitched in there somewhere ???<br>
<br>
Although everything looks like the other unit did, and they were finally<br>
able to get that to work !!<br>
<br>
Any suggestions ???<br>

Hi Wayne,<br>
I checked on your account. The "clipmail" can be viewed on the webmail. I<br>
had given the way to login to the serial number account some while back. It<br>
should be working for you now. If not, do a hard reset and then change the<br>
dialup number to the 800 number given to you and try.<br>

I forwarded the Webmail to the serial number email address, which hopefully<br>
is just the<br>
serial number @....  The model 350 did not receive it. Can you<br>
check to see if<br>
the test message I sent is in that mailbox ??<br>
<br>
If it is then I may have a bad mailstation, as it does not seem to want to<br>

Hi Wayne,<br>
I checked on your account. The "clipmail" can be viewed on the webmail. I<br>
had given the way to login to the serial number account some while back. It<br>
should be working for you now. If not, do a hard reset and then change the<br>
dialup number to the 800 number given to you and try.<br>
