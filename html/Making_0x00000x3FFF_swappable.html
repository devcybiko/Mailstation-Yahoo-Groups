<p class="formattedBody">How hard do you suppose it would be to make the first 16KB of address<br>
spac=<br>
e swappable, like the middle two "slots" can do?  I haven't gone<br>
over the =<br>
circuits hardly at all so I don't know really what does what<br>
at the moment=<br>
.  But if it wasn't too elaborate, and one could take<br>
advantage of some sp=<br>
are port or something like that, it might be<br>
worth trying.  Even if I had =<br>
to hard-wire the page of ram it went to,<br>
that'd be okay too.  And I know t=<br>
here's some undocumented pins on the<br>
CPU still.<br>
<br>
In FyOS, I've written in =<br>
compatibility for almost all of CP/M's BDOS<br>
function calls except file ope=<br>
rations.  Eventually I want to get that<br>
too.  But the point is, most CP/M =<br>
apps naturally expect to run from<br>
0x0100.  They call 0x0005 for BDOS funct=<br>
ions.  These two aspects<br>
alone aren't TOO bad; I mean, with a little work,=<br>
one could relocate<br>
a program to run at 0x4000 instead (which I've been do=<br>
ing to one for<br>
testing purposes)<br>
<br>
But obviously there's much more than sim=<br>
ple relocation most times,<br>
since various apps can have hard-coded memory l=<br>
ocations and routines<br>
that do things in places that'd require digging real=<br>
ly deep in the<br>
code, and truly learning what every aspect of the code is d=<br>
oing.  A<br>
very time consuming and outright confusing chore at times.<br>
<br>
So, o=<br>
bviously, I opt to take the easy way out if possible!  I'm not<br>
calling any=<br>
firmware functions at all, so I don't need anything from<br>
the first 16KB o=<br>
f address space once FyOS is running.  If I could<br>
just swap ram there, it =<br>
would be a much more functional system.  So<br>
I'm mostly wondering if anyone=<br>
has examined the hardware enough to<br>
determine if this is very possible?<br>
