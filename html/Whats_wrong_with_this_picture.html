<br>
So what is up with Earthlink ????<br>

I wish they would either pick the mailstation service back up<br>

<br>
With the U.S. postal service now cutting back the Saturday delivery and<br>
possibly rural area service, I expect that the Mailstation or something<br>
similiar would now be a very good money maker.<br>
<br>
Still haven't figured on how to re-program a Model 350. Hope somebody<br>
can figure it out. I had a few that I wanted to put on Earthlink, and<br>
one that I wanted to replace a 350 with another one, and Earthlink would<br>
not do it for me.<br>
<br>
NO new mailstation service or replacing existing units.<br>
<br>
I had to use a model 150 unit and set it up as the 350 was.<br>
My Aunt now has her service back.  She can't live with out it !!!!<br>

These units are great for the older generation, or the computer<br>

No, the 250 & 350 both had grey cases (I =<br>

shades of grey, though).  The unit in the picture is<br>

Bingo!!!!!<br>
<br>
But I think we=<br>
have to give Govind half the credit<br>
for noticing the "Yahoo!" icon.  Fort=<br>
unately there<br>
is no prize to fight over.  :-)<br>
<br>
The hardware appears to be =<br>
a "new 150" with blue-lcd,<br>
but the screen is really from your emulator run=<br>
ning<br>
2.53yr firmware, but using my latest blue-lcd colors<br>
that I "eyedrop=<br>
pered up" from the original photo.<br>
I suppose if I ran the actual 150 firm=<br>
ware, you guys<br>
would still be guessing.  :-)<br>
<br>
I thought the plain old "Mail=<br>
station" logo<br>
would the easiest thing to catch, but maybe I'm more<br>
aware o=<br>
f the differences than "normal" people.  :-)<br>
<br>
I also thought the "too perfe=<br>
ct" screen might give it away.<br>
<br>
The logo with no 100/150/200/250 after "Mai=<br>
lstation"<br>
means it is one of the earlier 2.xx firmware versions.<br>
It did no=<br>
t even occur to me that the 150 might not have<br>
had the "Yahoo!" feature.<br>
=<br>
<br>
I just checked a real blue-lcd 150, and it does not have<br>
"Yahoo!".  I dunn=<br>
o about the black-lcd 150's, I think<br>
they were made before Cidco sold to Ea=<br>
rthlink, so they<br>
might have it.  It's even possible there are 3 different<br>
=<br>
150's, because the box for this blue-lcd unit shows a<br>
black lcd with logo "=<br>
Mailstation 150" on the screen and<br>
front edge of keyboard.  I can't find my=<br>
black-lcd 150<br>
right now, but I am pretty sure it was a "Mivo 150" rather<br>
t=<br>
han a "Mailstation 150".<br>
<br>
The blue-lcd 150 says "Mailstation 150" in the lo=<br>
go, and<br>
doesn't seem to have the battery indicator.  AFAIK the<br>
blue *case*=<br>
was only used on the 150's (both black-lcd<br>
and blue-lcd versions).  And th=<br>
e blue *lcd* was only in<br>
the "new 150" & "new 120".  (I never have figured=<br>
out the<br>
difference between 150 & 120, other than case color.)<br>
<br>
There is n=<br>
o way the 2.53 firmware (or the fw from any<br>
earlier model) will run on the =<br>
blue-lcd hardware.<br>
<br>
It was kind of glaring to me, but then I thought<br>
most=<br>
would not know it wouldn't work, and think I had fed<br>
the 2.53 fw into a 15=<br>
0.  To my knowledge the blue lcd units<br>
require the 4.05 fw.<br>
<br>
And, of course=<br>
, if you look close enough, you can see<br>
the photo-editing is not perfect.<br>
