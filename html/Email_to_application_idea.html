<br>
If you mean the "TV listings" e=<br>
tc., they were just one big<br>
graphic image.  But I imagine they were sent as=<br>
mime attachments<br>
of some sort.  I was wondering if you could send executab=<br>
le<br>
binary code as the body of an email, and then just jump to the<br>
saved ema=<br>
il to run it.  But the more I think about it, I am<br>
not sure just what you c=<br>
ould send an email like that with.<br>
Certainly not any standard email client.=<br>
<br>
Usually even attached files are encoded as text, aren't they?<br>
<br>
It's proba=<br>
bly a better idea to send intel hex format, and have<br>
a loader on the mailst=<br>
ation decode it to binary.  And then<br>
it could write the binary to a free ap=<br>
p page!<br>
<br>
Or load it into ram and execute it.  That might require<br>
the mailst=<br>
ation reboot when done executing, unless you<br>
could find enough ram that is =<br>
unused (or rarely used???).<br>
