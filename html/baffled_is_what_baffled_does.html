I am baffled...I do the whole [FUNCTION] [SHIFT] [D] and power on thing and still get the main menu. I have an ancient printer so it's working nice as an old time word processor.<br>

I think it is just [FUNCTION] [D] and [power on]<br>
for the 150 & 120.  You should get a menu, with<br>
"reset default acct" as an option.<br>
<br>
Poking the reset button might be a lot easier than<br>
pulling the power (and might even work with batteies in).<br>
<br>
After picking "reset default acct", you answer Y, and almost<br>
immediately poke reset (or yank power cord).  The trick is<br>
to let it run just long enough to erase the old acct, but<br>
not long enough to finish re-writing the default acct info.<br>
<br>
IIRC, it is only a fraction of a second between the "yes"<br>
and when it writes the default account info, so the<br>
"sweet spot" that you need to catch it at is *very* short.<br>
You will likely need to try many times.<br>

Revise that to:<br>
<br>
[FUNCTION] [D] and [plug in power cord]<br>
<br>
*or*<br>
<br>
[FUNCTION] [D] and [press reset]<br>
<br>
The power button will not work (like it does to put<br>
older models in test mode).<br>
