Hi CJ,<br>
I've replaced the power supply for a new one (CIDCO original). The u=<br>
nit that is still working now passes all tests including DTMF and Modem.<br>
Th=<br>
e one that does not boot is still in the same situation, with the bridge on=<br>
it passes all tests too. May be the old power supply burned the power on/o=<br>
ff circuit.<br>
I'll try with AA batteries, but I would not bet on that works.<br>
=<br>
=C2=A0<br>
I've found the schematics for a 250, I think it;s is very simmilar t=<br>
o 100. Looking at it seems U303(74HC74) or Q304 (2SJ244)=C2=A0 can be the c=<br>
ulprit.<br>
I'll try to activate/deactivate the unit bridging G leg of Q304 to =<br>
check if it works. I'll measure the voltage at G leg pressing On/off switch=<br>
to see if the flipflop is working ok.<br>
=C2=A0<br>

Eduardo.<br>
