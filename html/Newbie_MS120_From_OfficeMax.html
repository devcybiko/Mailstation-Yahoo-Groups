<p class="formattedBody">The LCD says "Mailstation 120"; on the back "MIVO 200 DET2".<br>
<br>
None of the keyboard tricks I'm reading about seem to work.<br>
<br>
Pressing SHIFT+FUNCTION+T and powering on doesn't do anything.<br>
<br>
Am I doing something wrong?<br>
<br>
Is there a FAQ?<br>
<br>
Is there a "better" (more hackable) model to look for?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Can these be used with mailbug?<br>

FWIW, I ran back to the store and also nabbed an MS150 (Earthlink).  Seems to suffer<br>

I believe that Earthlink 'locked' them to prevent changing ISPs. Until we<br>

<p class="formattedBody">My guess is that the 150 will work with Mailbug, the remote debugger<br>
soon (CJ has verified that it doesn't work yet, but the reflash protocol<br>
is the same... that's good luck).<br>
<br>
So once that is all working, you could conceivably load whatever<br>
software you want on it including a hacked version of the software (or<br>
an older rev might do what you need too).<br>
<br>
Are you planning to use it just for email, or for something else?<br>

I agree! I've made similar noises here but done nothing about it (too<br>
many projects).<br>
<br>
How about porting Z80 CamelForth to the ms?<br>
<br>
I'm guessing it's one or two weekends of work, and then the MS is<br>
stand-alone programmable, we could even put the editor and assembler in<br>
ROM along with the Forth core.<br>

There's a reference to a Z180 port that is standalone.<br>

No. The kernel gets flashed to ROM, then you interface with it over the<br>
parallel port, (we'd need some kind of terminal program that talks over<br>
parallel port on the DOS side) creating new definitions as you play.<br>
<br>
In fact, traditionally Forth implements a "BLOCKS" wordset where<br>
whatever storage you've got is divided into 64 X 16 blocks. So in a way,<br>
classic Forth comes with its own file system approach that could be<br>
used. I'm sure someone has done something to make a BLOCKS wordset that<br>
works well with industrial flash chips (i.e. tries not to rewrite the<br>
same blocks all the time).<br>

(Note these cover older vintages of Forth, so many words are different,<br>
but the core ideas are the same).<br>

My hope is to turn it into a 'Super' Radio Shack Model 100 laptop. BTW,<br>
looking on the Earthlink site it looks like they are not selling the Mivo<br>
anymore. If they opened it up they could get more than $9 for them!<br>

The thought has occurred to me... how are we going to do that without<br>
battery backed RAM? I guess when we power down, we could write the RAM<br>
image to flash. That's if the "power" button is pressed. But what if we<br>
get a hard power failure... (no batteries, and DC adapter is pulled out,<br>
or batteries die) I'm guessing there wouldn't be enough time to write it<br>
out.<br>

The ms RAM stays powered from the batteries when the power<br>
is switched off via the power button.  Would that be enough?<br>

(It doesn't seem like too much of a hardship to keep batteries<br>
in it if you need battery-backed RAM!  :-)<br>

Ah, didn't realize that. I figured it stored all files on flash, so why<br>
would it battery back the RAM?<br>
<br>
Anyway that's good news (to me).<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes I suppose that's true. But the Model 100 has a nicad soldered to the<br>
motherboard. It almost never gets used, spending most of its time fully<br>
charged off either the battery or the wall cube. So if you leave an M100<br>
on the shelf, the main batteries will die. But months later you turn the<br>
thing on and all your files are still there!<br>
<br>
Unlike say the Cambridge Z88, which doesn't have a battery backup but<br>
just a capacitor similar to the way a Palm Pilot works. It's hard to get<br>
the batteries changed in the short period of time you have from the<br>
warning, especially if you're using rechargeables.<br>
<br>
On an M100 you have a very long time before the memory will die even<br>
with a warning and dead main batteries.<br>
