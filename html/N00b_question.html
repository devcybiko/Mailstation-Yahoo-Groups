<p class="formattedBody">Just bought one of the infamous $9.00 MS120s; had gotten as far as<br>
identifying the chips involved when I found this group and<br>
discovered that a lot of my work had been done for me. Anybody got<br>
any input on the idea of using the MS120 as a serial console for<br>
headless Linux machines? Does the CXNT modem chip need rs232 inputs?<br>
There has to be VT100 code for Z80s out there somewhere. It would be<br>
a STUNNINGLY useful piece of equipment in that role...<br>
<br>
Any ideas?<br>

I think CJ has done some stuff with bit banging a serial port=<br>
using<br>
the parallel port. But you'll need to add a level converter at least=<br>
.<br>
<br>
Also for cheap slabtops that make good terminals out-of-the-box<br>
there's =<br>
the Tandy WP-2, the Tandy 10x, Tandy 200, the Amstrad NC100,<br>
or the Cambrid=<br>
ge Z88 (with the serial port rewired to standard<br>
ideally).<br>
