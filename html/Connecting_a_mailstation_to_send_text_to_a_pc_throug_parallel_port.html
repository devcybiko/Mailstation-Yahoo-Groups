<p class="formattedBody">Hello, I want to use the mailstation to type text and then send it to<br>
a pc directly throug its parallel port. This is my idea: Create a new<br>

and writes it to a file.<br>

Now here is my question: Does anybody know wich pins of the rs-422 on<br>
the mailstation have to have a "1" or a "0" to make it believe that<br>
it is connected to a printer? Because I tried with many combinations<br>
