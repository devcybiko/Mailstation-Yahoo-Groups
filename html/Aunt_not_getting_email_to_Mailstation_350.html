A few questions and then some suggestions !!<br>
<br>
One: Is the email account "Overloaded". There is a limit to the email<br>
accounts memory.<br>
Go delete anything that was over a week or two old. Then check it again.<br>
<br>
If she can still send email, then the unit sounds like it is working OK.<br>
<br>
TWO: Can you do a manual "Get mail" by pushing the email button, and see if<br>
it connects and<br>
gets the mail ??? If that is OK, then the "Times" that the unit goes to get<br>
mail is off or bad.<br>
<br>
THREE: Check the "settings" to see if everything is still correct, or was<br>
changed somehow ???<br>
<br>
If it is still not working, call Earthlink tech support, and ask them to<br>
"RE-load" the authorization<br>
for the unit.  You will need the serial number of the unit. You must be able<br>
to verify that you<br>
have the authority to call in for this account.<br>
<br>
DO NOT DO A "RESET" without tech support directing you to do it !!!<br>
<br>
I have a couple of units for my older relatives, that aren't "computer<br>
savvy", at first they were<br>
very skittish to try the units, but now they can't live without them. They<br>
have become parts<br>
of their lives. They are now able to almost instantly communicate with their<br>
friends and relatives,<br>
and that improves their quality of life !!!<br>

Hi All,<br>
<br>
My wife's aunt, has Earthlink and the Mailstation 350. She is 73<br>
years old and this represents the only way she can do email, which<br>
has become very important to her. Initially, she was able to<br>
sporadically receive emails. Now, none are getting through.<br>
<br>
After going through which was her valid email account (i.e., the one<br>
with the number, the name@...) and making sure we were<br>
sending plain text, she is still not receiving any email on the<br>
Mailstation 350. Her outbound email does work.<br>
<br>
We have logged on to the web client - www.earthlink.net - and we are<br>
able to see her emails, but they don't get through to her. Does<br>
anyone have any ideas on this? Can the Earthlink customer service<br>
people help?<br>
<br>
In previous discussions, a "hard re-set" has been mentioned. How is<br>
this done? Unfortunately, we don't have the manual.<br>
<br>
Appreciate any help and thanks to all of you.<br>
