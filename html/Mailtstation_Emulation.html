Hiya folks, been a while since I checked here.  Nice to see there's at<br>
leas=<br>
t been a few posts recently, though!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I was trying to get a version=<br>
of CP/M written a while back for<br>
the Mailstation, and even did that hardwa=<br>
re mod for banking out the<br>
first 16KB of address space with ram just specif=<br>
ically for that.  But<br>
then a combination of distractions as well as the lof=<br>
ty goals of writing<br>
like a storage system for the Flash memory and everythi=<br>
ng just kind of<br>
pulled me away from Mailstation work.<br>
<br>
Part was laziness to=<br>
o though, I admit, since it's tedious to write code<br>
on the PC, compile, tra=<br>
nsfer it to the Mailstation, see if it works.  If<br>
not, try to debug what ha=<br>
ppened by trying to write things to the screen,<br>
etc.  And even then you're =<br>
not getting all the information you might<br>
want for debugging purposes, espe=<br>
cially if you crashed it.  Definitely a<br>
pain.<br>
<br>
So recently, when the notion=<br>
of messing around with the MS again started<br>
rattling around in my head, I =<br>
realized that the only reasonable way for<br>
me to continue developing anythin=<br>
g elaborate was to emulate the hardware<br>
on the PC.  More lofty goals!<br>
<br>
But =<br>
the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the hardest<br>
part was =<br>
going to be the CPU.  And as luck would have it, I found<br>
something called l=<br>
ibz80 to do the job for me.  It has hooks for<br>
reading/writing memory and I/=<br>
O, which works great for all the<br>
device/page switching that the Mailstation=<br>
does.<br>
<br>
Well, turns out, libz80 has a ton of emulation bugs, which were mes=<br>
sing<br>
me up for a few days.  I've corrected many of them in the source (it's=<br>
<br>
very well written and easy to modify compared to another z80 emulation<br>
lib=<br>
rary I saw), and notified the author, who seemed eager to get a fixed<br>
versi=<br>
on up as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
So now, after much debugging and digging throug=<br>
h assembly output, I've<br>
successfully gotten to what appears to be a Mailsta=<br>
tion error screen,<br>
and then the cpu is intentionally halted. =A0Here's an i=<br>
mage:<br>
<br>
I have no idea what is resulting in the behavior at this point, bu=<br>
t it's<br>
the first visible indication of progress so far, so I thought I'd sh=<br>
are<br>
it for anyone interested.<br>
<br>
As for the technical details:<br>
<br>
- The Mailsta=<br>
tion memory map is properly emulated, with codeflash page 0<br>
in the first 16=<br>
K, and RAM page 0 in the last 16K.<br>
- Device/page switching via I/O ports is=<br>
functional for the middle two<br>
16K slots<br>
- Devices emulated so far: RAM (re=<br>
ad/write), Codeflash (read), Dataflash<br>
(read/write), LCD (write)<br>
- Dataflas=<br>
h has sector-erase and byte-program chip functions emulated<br>
- LCD is curren=<br>
tly written into buffers (one for each LCD half), and<br>
later dumped to separ=<br>
ate files. =A0The LCD CAS bit is properly emulated<br>
to make this possible. =<br>
=A0I've written a separate utility to convert<br>
the raw binary files into vie=<br>
wable BMP images.<br>
<br>
I've started writing in PDCurses support to give a deb=<br>
ugger interface.<br>
Though I've also done /raw and /silent command line switc=<br>
hes.  The<br>
former dumps disassembly and debug output straight to the screen,=<br>
which<br>
can be redirected to a file.  The latter disables all output, speedi=<br>
ng<br>
emulation up considerably.  I've actually done 100% of my debugging so<br>
f=<br>
ar by using /raw and dumping to a text file, which has grown upwards to<br>
200=<br>
MB!  I'm hoping to get the debugging interface working eventually to<br>
avoid =<br>
this roundabout way of doing it.<br>
<br>
Another possibly interesting tidbit is th=<br>
at I'm modifying the codeflash<br>
at emulator startup, and changing the Mailst=<br>
ation's delay() function to<br>
simply RET immediately.  It was outputting tons=<br>
of useless information<br>
during that call.  I don't think this will hurt my =<br>
emulation at all,<br>
especially since I'm not even emulating interrupts/timers=<br>
yet.<br>
<br>
I'm running on the Mailstation v2.53 firmware for this, with a dataf=<br>
lash<br>
dump I made from my v3.03 firmware.  I have no idea if this will cause=<br>
<br>
issues, but it's the only dataflash image I have.  The reason I'm using<br>
th=<br>
e 2.53 firmware is because I have a very commented disassembly file of<br>
code=<br>
flash page 0 for that version, which has helped a ton in debugging.<br>
I woul=<br>
d love to have more disassembled pages with comments like this, if<br>
anyone h=<br>
as them!  I've spent a lot of time commenting some of the later<br>
pages mysel=<br>
f to the best of my ability, which has slowed me down a lot.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the n=<br>
ext biggest thing is to get the LCD actually emulated<br>
visually in real-time=<br>
.  In order to make it all as cross-platform as<br>
possible, I might be able t=<br>
o do it with SDL, but I'll have to see what I<br>
can do.<br>
<br>
The other big thing =<br>
is to track down why the Mailstation is halting<br>
after showing this screen. =<br>
It'll take a lot more digging through<br>
disassembled Mailstation source I gu=<br>
ess, since the initialization<br>
routine it was running was in another page of=<br>
the codeflash.  But I'm<br>
still making progress, albeit slowly!<br>
<br>

I've made some progress, after muchhhh firmware disassembly, tracing<br>
throu=<br>
gh the startup procedure. =A0<br>
<br>
First up, I've gone to SDL for graphics, so =<br>
now the LCD can be updated<br>
in mostly real-time (not too often though or it =<br>
slows down emulation<br>
considerably).<br>
<br>
I emulated the power and battery bits =<br>
of port 9, so that it actually<br>
thinks it's not about to burn out. =A0This g=<br>
ot rid of the previous<br>
screen I was seeing (which I assume was a low batter=<br>
y warning, despite<br>
the missing text), and now simply displayed the logo ins=<br>
tead (without<br>
the blank message box on top) before halting.<br>
<br>
So after a whi=<br>
le of more tracing through things, I realized that maybe I<br>
just needed to w=<br>
arm-boot the system, since it does have a cold-boot<br>
procedure too, and it s=<br>
eemed to be running this every time (messing with<br>
dataflash, setting up ram=<br>
, etc). =A0So upon receiving the CPU halt, I<br>
told it to simply reboot autom=<br>
atically instead (keeping ram/dataflash<br>
changes intact). =A0Then, low and b=<br>
ehold:<br>
<br>
Same shot as above, except from the v3.03 firmware:<br>
<br>
I th=<br>
ink maybe an interrupt automatically wakes it back up normally<br>
instead of h=<br>
aving to push the power button again? =A0I'll have to look<br>
into it more. =<br>
=A0<br>
<br>
Anyway, I tried the v3.03 firmware again to see if that would make a<br>
=<br>
difference due to the dataflash image I'm using, but I still get the<br>
reset =<br>
menu. =A0Which I later remembered is what normally happens when<br>
you cold-bo=<br>
ot a Mailstation. =A0<br>
<br>
I also tried setting the "bootstate" ram byte to 0x5=<br>
a at startup to<br>
avoid all the cold-boot initialization stuff, to maybe get =<br>
straight to<br>
the main menu, but it just perpetually reboots then. =A0I'm obv=<br>
iously<br>
missing something it needs/wants to work properly in that respect.<br>
<br>
=<br>
So it looks like the next step is to properly emulate keypresses, in<br>
order =<br>
to get past this screen! =A0That'll require triggering an<br>
interrupt too. =<br>
=A0Only part I'm worried about is that I seem to recall<br>
the key scanning fu=<br>
nction relies on a timer to know how long you've held<br>
down a key, and I don=<br>
't know if I'll ever be able to emulate that with<br>
complete accuracy (especi=<br>
ally since the Z80 cpu library I'm using just<br>
emulates instructions, not cl=<br>
ock cycles). =A0But we'll see.<br>
<br>
<br>
through the startup procedure. =A0&lt;/P>&lt;P>First up, I've gone to SDL for gra=<br>
