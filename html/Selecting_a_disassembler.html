<p class="formattedBody">Do you have a suggestion for a disassembler for the Z-80?<br>
<br>
I have used a disassembler on some Motorola 6803 ROMs that accepted a<br>
symbol file, which defined symbols and associated them with<br>
addresses. The disaasembler used the symbols as it created the<br>
source. This was very useful. Even nicer would be the ability to add<br>
documentation to the symbol file and have it appear in the generated<br>
listing at the corresponding locations in the code.<br>
<br>
I will do some research on this topic, but I'd love hear your<br>
experiences.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Thanks for the list. Ida seems interesting. The disassembler that I<br>
have used in the past is called DASMx. It is downloadable for free on<br>
the Web. I particularly like 2 of its features - code threading and<br>
symbol files.<br>
<br>
Code threading automatically follows jump and branch instructions to<br>
find additional streams of code to disassemble.<br>
<br>
The symbol files allow the user to identify code, data, character<br>
strings, and pointers. The disassembler uses the symbols specified in<br>
the file whenever the location is referenced in the code. As you<br>
learn more about the structure of the software, and update the symbol<br>
file with the new information, successive disassemblies become more<br>
and more useful.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">There were MANY of these for the Z-80. Search using TRS-80. Many of<br>
these were written in old versions of MS Basic, but can be ported OK.<br>
A good place to start is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trs-80.com/">(URL)</a><br>
