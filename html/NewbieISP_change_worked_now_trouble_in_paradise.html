<p class="formattedBody">Hi<br>
<br>
Well, the instructions below worked fine (DET-1 is the "original"<br>
model, I guess!)<br>
<br>
Now I have a new problem. I am using the unit to access a POP3<br>
account (deluxe version of Yahoo! mail) and so I entered in<br>
pop.mail.yahoo.com for the POP3 setting. And of course<br>
smtp.mail.yahoo.com for the outgoing server setting.<br>
<br>
Guess who can receive mail on his Mailstation, but not send it!<br>
<br>
The Yahoo help site says that "some Internet service providers will<br>
block port 25. If you experience technical problems sending email,<br>
then you will need to use port 587 when sending via Yahoo!'s SMTP<br>
server."<br>
<br>
Ug...I have no idea whether that's the real problem, and if it is,<br>
how to go about changing the port!<br>
<br>
Any one have ideas??<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
<br>

Maybe you could try configuring your desktop client to dial up and talk<br>
to Yahoo. If that doesn't work then the port is probably blocked, in<br>
which case you'll need to find a proxy server which will forward your<br>
SMTP packets.<br>
<br>
For a more direct test, you can usually use telnet (on desktop) to<br>
connect to arbitrary TCP ports, in this case 25. Try hittng enter, or<br>
HELO (or ELHO?) you should get a response from the server. If you are<br>
able to connect and get a response then your ISP is not blocking port<br>
25.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not sure how to change the port (if it's possible at all)<br>

Two possibilities - smtp.mail.yahoo.com isn't the outgoing system, OR the<br>
password is wrong. Neither SHOULD be possible, but strange things do happen.<br>
I was able to hook one of these up to my ISP OK.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Have you tried putting in a host name of smtp.mail.yahoo.com:547  (or<br>
whatever that other port # was?)<br>
