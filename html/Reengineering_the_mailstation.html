<p class="formattedBody">Hello all,<br>
<br>
Warning: rambling ahead.<br>
<br>
I have been clearing out stuff in my =<br>
shop and have found the two<br>
mailstations I hacked a few years ago.<br>
<br>
My firs=<br>
t thought was to give this units away to someone.<br>
<br>
My second thought was to=<br>
re-engineer these units in someway.<br>
<br>
Plastic cases are a problem for one o=<br>
ff projects.<br>
<br>
The mailstation is old technology and I would like to bring i=<br>
t up to a<br>
more recent processor.<br>
<br>
The LCD display and keyboard are as good =<br>
as any.<br>
<br>
The builtin battery pack is very usefull.<br>
<br>
The modem is a waste. I=<br>
am sure people in this group will look for a<br>
hotspot before using a modem.=<br>
<br>
So, my thought is desiging a card that would replace the main board in<br>
th=<br>
e mailstation.<br>
<br>
[ Idea 1 ]<br>
<br>
A full 32-bit cpu with a couple of megs of memo=<br>
ry (flash/ram), an<br>
ethernet interface would be nice, but we would be talkin=<br>
g about a<br>
$100/$200+ retrofit.<br>
<br>
Someone to layout the board, get them manu=<br>
factured, put parts on them.<br>
<br>
[ Idea 2 ]<br>
<br>
A 32 bit single chip cpu with eno=<br>
ugh memory would make a reasonable<br>
development platform.<br>
<br>
Maybe one of the =<br>
larger single chip cpus for NXP.<br>
<br>
Has anyhone measured out the main board i=<br>
n the MS ?<br>
<br>
The back panel has only a few openings but it may be enough.<br>
<br>
A=<br>
dd a compact flash for an 802.11 interface, an SPI interface for SD<br>
cards.<br>
=<br>
<br>
[ Idea 3 ]<br>
<br>
Finding a low cost cpu board that we can build a carrier to pl=<br>
ug it<br>
into the MS plastic.<br>
<br>
Ok, what do you think.<br>
<br>
Some summer project to =<br>
keep us from mowing the lawn :-).<br>

<p class="formattedBody">The mailstation case and keyboard are not worth saving.<br>
<br>
One thought is to start with a TRS-80 Model 100 or Tandy 102 case.<br>
Much more room to work. Has a built-in 4 AA battery holder.<br>
<br>
I think a MS display would fit in there.<br>
<br>
The keyboard is much better than the MS's<br>
<br>
If the CPU is fast enough, you could run VirtualT and have a<br>
supercharged Model 100 :-)<br>
<br>
I will donate a case and KB if you design a PCB.<br>
<br>
As far as CPU I would go for low power, long battery life.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">I have a couple of MS's that I thought of doing something similar. I<br>
wasn't able to find out how to drive the LCD with another processor. I<br>
decoded the keyboard and was able to make a functional serial terminal<br>
by using a different display. But my alternate display didn't fit the<br>
case at all. I used a Mega32 AVR microcontroller to drive the LCD and<br>
read the keyboard. It had more than enough power to act as a serial<br>
terminal...<br>

Anyone have success trying to drive the LCD?<br>

My 2 cents:<br>
You have to find something that is worthwhile to be sold to the general<br>
public or else it is NOT going to<br>
be built in a Mass big enough to get the price down to reasonable !!<br>
<br>
The Mailstation concept is still doable !!!  A lot of people out there do<br>
not have a computer, do not understand<br>
how a computer runs, and do not want to put up with the hassles of owning<br>
and maintaining one. This especially<br>
goes for the Senior Citizens in this country.<br>
BUT THEY STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE WORLD !!!<br>
<br>
I have set up several Mailstations for some of my Senior relatives, and<br>
although they were leery to use it, they<br>
now don't know how they would survive without it.  The world has gone from<br>
written letters to electronic ones, and<br>
the electronic ones are there is minutes.<br>
<br>
The Mailstation just needs to be updated, and allowed to be used on ANY<br>
email server unit. This would allow<br>
the user to then search and find the best service for them and connect the<br>
unit to it.<br>
<br>
The new unit should be patterned after the Model 350, which allows the<br>
downloading of pictures and larger<br>
emails.  Since memory has come a long way since the Mailstation's inception,<br>
it is now efficient to include<br>
larger memory in the unit.<br>
<br>
Some of the faster, laptop CPU's would work with their lower power<br>
consumption.  Even a older Pentium chip<br>
would still be faster than what the original Mailstation had in it.<br>
<br>
Biggest problem would be watching to not step on any patents that still<br>
might be used in the device.<br>
<br>
The option of a plug-in WIFI card is a good one, let the option slot take<br>
either a Modem, WIFI, or Ethernet<br>
plug in card. That way whichever service is going to be used can be<br>
accommodated easily and without having to<br>
load all that extra circuitry into the unit and not use it. That would also<br>
keep the cost down for the unit.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts,<br>

Your thinking of the Model 350. This has a 900 Mhz. wireless connection to<br>
it's<br>
plug-in modem unit, so the Model 350 can be used remotely in the room and<br>
not<br>
have to be used where the telephone line plugs in.  It is not compatible<br>
with<br>
the 2 Gig WIFI stuff.  And changing the wireless unit out in the Model 350<br>
would<br>
mean that you would have to get the unit type accepted again by the FCC.<br>
<br>
Easiest way is to use an "Option slot" for these. That way it would take<br>
anyone's<br>
unit, (Which is already FCC type accepted), and you would not have to mess<br>
around<br>
with it.  It would also keep the cost down by not requiring each unit to<br>
have all three<br>
hookup cards, (WIFI, Ethernet, Modem) inside the main unit.  I don't see any<br>
situation<br>
where you would be using more than one connection type at one time ??<br>
<br>
You could go with the Linux software, since it is considered "Freeware", and<br>
you would<br>
not have to pay Microsoft any royalties for anything.  But it would require<br>
more time<br>
compiling an Operating system for this specific use.  Actually, Linux uses<br>
less space<br>
to run than Windows does, and works with more stuff.  The Boot up Kernel can<br>
be "Edited"<br>
so as to just allow it to install and access only the drivers and devices<br>
that you needed it too.<br>
Unlike Windows, which loads everything under the sun on your system. A lot<br>
of which is<br>
not needed for your specific applications.  Linux will run well with even a<br>
