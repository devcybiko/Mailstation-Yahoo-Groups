I have the MS120 (same one from Office Max for $9) and have success in unlocking it.<br>
<br>
To do it:<br>
<br>
1. Remove batteries - they must be out to do this!<br>
2. Prepare AC adapter for use to power the mailstation.  You will need to be able to quickly and easily disconnect it..<br>
3. press (and hold) [FUNCTION] [SHIFT] [D] and power on.  A menu should appear.<br>
4. Select *Restore Email Defaults" from the menu.  Press Enter. It will prompt "are you sure? YES / NO"<br>
5. As soon as you press YES, you need to quickly interrupt the power to the unit-- corrupting the user account information in flash.<br>
** Step #5 takes some tries-- dont give up, keep trying!<br>
6. If you got it right, you can power up and select "NO Clear" (if a menu appears) and you should see "Press OK to configure a user account"<br>
7. Once you press Enter, you will get to put in the login info (name/password, etc) ..<br>
<br>
Sadly, you must go thru this to change it after, so let someone patient do it for you.. I have done it, and it works!<br>

did it, reset, started smoking... it started shaking.. and a picture<br>
of Bill Gates came on the screen....  It said "I'm sorry this is not<br>
an approved Microsoft product"...<br>
<br>
ok back to reality...<br>
<br>
I think the keybaord is perfect for applications, ta heck with hacking<br>
it.  has anyone figured out the internal cable coordination so this<br>
might be used for somethign else?  This is just perfect.<br>
<br>
I have the MS120 and 15 from Officemax.  It really woudl be nice to<br>
short this and c9orrect the memory so its forced to reset... anyone<br>
think abotu that?<br>
<br>
enjoy.<br>
