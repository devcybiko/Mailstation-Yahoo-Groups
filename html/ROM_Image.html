I can make an image of my rom, how would you like it ?<br>

Intel hex, binary, ascii hex ??<br>

I want to discover the hardware specs and completely<br>
rewrite the firmware.  I have found that there appears<br>
to be messages in the 2.xx version which indicate<br>
through-parallel port re-imaging.  If this is true, I<br>
would like to start reprogramming the device from<br>
scratch.  Sure, I like the MS, but it would be fun for<br>
me and my kids to actually start with a clean system.<br>

Just to be clear, the copy of the ROM image in the Files section is the Model 100, right?<br>
<br>
All the parts listed match the parts in my 100, so I supposed that the ROM does, too.<br>

Yes Jim, Its version 2.53yr.<br>
<br>
That dump was created by the hardware in the photo section<br>
under 'ROM DUMP'.<br>
<br>
I have not been able to get that hardware working again. So a single<br>
file of my version of ROM will take longer than I thought.<br>
<br>
If that 'ROM DUMP' file is good enough, I'll move on to something else.<br>

That dump seems just fine. I have used a little Pascal program to<br>
convert it into 64 16KB binary files (based on the notes from<br>
ThePinkPanther) and started disassembling them using DASMx 1.30.<br>
<br>
I need to stop for a while, so I'm in the process of writing up what<br>
I have done so far, in the hopes of encouraging someone else to<br>
continue it for a while. I will upload the binary files that I<br>
created and describe what I have done and learned so far. I hope to<br>
have it done by next week some time.<br>

This has been the basic problem with the MS device.<br>
<br>
The main code ROM is a surface mount chip, soldered down to the board.<br>
As I posted is message 13, people have been trying to figure out how<br>
the MS works internally.<br>
<br>
There seem to be more software people here than hardware people who<br>
are willing to actually hack their hardware. I have one unit that is<br>
no longer functioning. I bought a second unit so I can still play with<br>
one.<br>
<br>
If the code in the file section can be hacked so we all can see how<br>
the "uploading code" function works, we can use that to re-load any MS<br>
device. ( but read my comments in message 13 )<br>
<br>
There is also a potental problem, that MS engineers changed the way<br>
latter versions reload their code. ( or maybe they removed it<br>
altogether, we have no way of knowing )<br>
<br>
On my MS, I removed the code ROM and inserted a surface mount socket.<br>
( but I missplaced the ROM chip in a recent move )<br>
Thats why I bought a second unit.<br>
<br>
I have been looking into replacing that code althgether with my own<br>
ROM. Time is my current enemy.<br>
<br>
Please review the ROM dump we have now. Maybe you will see something<br>
others have missed, this may help others crack this code.<br>

Opportunity is missed by most people,<br>

For anyone who may be interested.<br>
<br>
I posted a pic of my MS with surface mount sockets.<br>
<br>
The pic shows a ribbon cable (on the left) soldered to the RAM chip.<br>
<br>
I connected the other end to a logic analyzer. Tracing with the logic<br>
analyzer, I can see Z80 code executing. ( So I am sure its a Z80 )<br>
<br>
But now I have to find the ROM that goes into that socket. :-(<br>
<br>
If I can find a serial port on this chip, I will burn a chip with a<br>
debugger. I have used a debugger in the past call NOICE.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.noicedebugger.com/">(URL)</a><br>
<br>
This can be used to check whats inside the chip. ( along with a logic<br>
analyzer )<br>

I was wondering if you could elaborate on these comments<br>
from message 13:<br>
<br>
13>Now if someone ever figured out how to externally re-load code, so<br>
13>any non-tech type can reflash their roms. That would be cutting them out.<br>
<br>
Reflashing is what we are trying to do here, right?  Are you saying that we<br>
should stop short of posting a reflash app???<br>
<br>
13>I had always thought the posting about $100 to anyone who can reflash<br>
13>thier MS was posted by someone at earthlink. ( we have a $100 bill for<br>
13>you, just give us your name and address )<br>
<br>
I had assumed that was just a joke, since their was no way<br>
to contact "hacker howard".  Why do you think earthlink<br>
would want a name and address?  Nasty letter from<br>
the legal dept.???<br>
<br>
Does anyone in this group work for earthlink????<br>

<p class="date">May 23, 2004</p>
<p class="formattedBody">IANAL, but IMHO It doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
engineer the code in order to use a device I bought.<br>
<br>
I never agreed to anything with any company Earthlink, Cidco, or<br>
otherwise. I haven't even connected the thing to an ISP, so there is no<br>
chance that I ever Clicked through a license agreement of any kind.<br>
<br>
I bought the unit, I can do anything I want with it. I can erase the<br>
flash, I can replace it with something else. I can take a sledgehammer<br>
to it, etc. It's property, I own it. That said, I can't make copies of<br>
the software within for redistribution to people who don't own a<br>
mailstation due to copyright law. And if we find some encryption<br>
anywhere that is intended to prevent copying of the software we aren't<br>
allowed to break it (see: DMCA). But we haven't seen anything like that,<br>
AFAIK. In any event for the purposes here I can't see how that would be<br>
a proper application of DMCA, but I am not a lawyer.<br>
<br>
Certainly the end product of a reflash app could never be an<br>
infringement of copyright since we don't have access to the source code<br>
of the original reflash application. And as above, I'm not breaking any<br>
license agreement or contract since I never made any agreement.<br>
<br>
So once we get to an actual reflash app I think there is even less to<br>
worry about, since it will all be original code. I'd be more worried<br>
about posting the original binary images than the reflash app, since<br>
someone who doesn't own a CIDCO Det1 might download it, and that would<br>
be an illegal distribution (copyright infringement) under copyright law.<br>
<br>
As everyone here knows the $100 reward is a joke any way you look at it,<br>
at least if you're using the brute force approach which is what it seems<br>
we're left with. I wonder how much that $100/hour would divide out to<br>
with the man-hours spent so far on this effort?<br>
<br>
Hopefully we're all having fun with this, since that's all this is<br>
really about...<br>
