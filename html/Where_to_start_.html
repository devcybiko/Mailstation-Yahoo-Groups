Mailbug is a program I wrote that will let you loa=<br>

On the older DET1 models, you power up=<br>

<br>
You don'=<br>

<br>
Installing sb=<br>

wipe out most of the original f=<br>

If you would like to keep your original firmwa=<br>

you might want to wait for version 0.0.4 (hopefully<br>

Well there are lots of C and Pascal compilers for Z80. Most of them need<br>
to run under a CP/M emulator and target a CP/M environment, but whether<br>
generated code is dependent on the environment is usually a function of<br>
the nature of the code itself, not the compiler.<br>
<br>
There's also sdcc which comes with full source code.<br>

<br>
To my knowledge no one has used these with Mailstation yet. If you want<br>
to generate short swaths of code I think you wouldn't have to do<br>
anything special. If you want to use the standard library they provide,<br>
you'll need to modify them so that they use the built in I/O routines or<br>
you need to write your own i/o routines.<br>

<br>
What you said finally sunk in to my brain toda=<br>
y.  I don't think we would<br>
need the putchar or getchar routines at all, as =<br>
long as we are not writing<br>
an old-fashioned-user-interface style program.  =<br>
(O-FUI????)  &lt;lmao><br>
<br>
If you are writing an event-driven GUI style app, you =<br>
don't ever<br>
do any input yourself.  The OS receives the input, and packages=<br>
up the<br>
keystrokes from the keyboard (and input from other devices) and<br>
pa=<br>
sses them to your program as *parameters* in calls to your apps<br>
event-handl=<br>
er.  You would never call getchar.<br>
<br>
This is the format for the mailstations=<br>
event records:<br>
(who, signal, this, that)<br>
<br>
"who" is the app number tha=<br>
t the event is for.<br>
"signal" is the event type (such as keydown, keyup, etc=<br>
).<br>
"this" and "that" are the data payload that go with the particular event=<br>
.<br>
In the case of key events, "this" is scancode, and "that" is ascii.<br>
<br>
A ma=<br>
ilstation app is basically an event handler.  The mailstation<br>
OS passes the=<br>
se parameters to your apps event handler:<br>
handleevent(who, state, sign=<br>
al, this, that);<br>
<br>
"state" is a single byte state variable that the OS keeps=<br>
track of<br>
for your app, between calls to handleevent.  (handleevent returns=<br>
<br>
this "state" on exit as the function result.)<br>
The other four parameters =<br>
are the event.<br>
<br>
<br>

Come to think of it, what program isn't? ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
I typically call this state a "cookie" or "(execution) context." The<br>
server/kernel/OS lets you register it with the system and it just<br>
returns it to the client application as-is. I would guess it is fairly<br>
easy to trade the cookie for a memory pointer which holds the rest of<br>
the application's state (object oriented types would call this memory<br>
"Self" or "This").<br>
