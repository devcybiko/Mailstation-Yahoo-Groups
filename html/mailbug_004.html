<p class="from">From: "Cyrano Jones" &lt;cyranojones_lalp@...></p>
<p class="date">Aug 13, 2007</p>
<p class="formattedBody">I uploaded a bunch of stuff: mailbug 0.0.4, bootapp, new version<br>
of helloap=<br>
p, and some comment files for mailbugs disassembler.<br>
Also a file called cru=<br>
nch.dat, which has tags for data and code.<br>
(Comments and crunch.dat are for=<br>
2.53yr.)<br>
<br>
New in 0.0.4 is mainly ability to load splash screen in stock<br>
ma=<br>
ilstation, and ability to embed bootapp.rom file in<br>
the splash screen.  It =<br>
has to be named bootapp.rom, and it<br>
needs to be in mbug subdir.<br>
<br>
Splash scr=<br>
een files need to be in monochrome .bpm format.<br>
Max size is 320x128.  I see=<br>
m to remember having trouble<br>
with smaller images, but that might be fixed n=<br>
ow???<br>
Filenames need to be "splashX.bmp", where X is a number.<br>
You need a f=<br>
ile named "splash6.bmp" if you want to load<br>
bootapp, 'coz I hardcoded it to=<br>
embed bootapp.rom in<br>
that image file.  Splash image files go in subdir "mi=<br>
sc".<br>
<br>
0.0.4 also has the "inhale" function, but it is not in menu.<br>
Command =<br>
is "&lt;", and I don't remember exactly how you get it<br>
to sync with "spew", yo=<br>
u might need to run both at almost<br>
exact same time to avoid timeouts.  boot=<br>
app makes this<br>
obsolete, though.  You can just "save" rom image after<br>
load=<br>
ing bootapp.<br>
<br>
One other notable new feature of 0.0.4 is a symbol table.<br>
The=<br>
symbol data is stored as a comment with a special tag<br>
that tells disassemb=<br>
ler it is a symbol, and value is simply<br>
the address where that comment is f=<br>
ound.  Disassembler<br>
will plug symbol in whenever it sees that address.<br>
<br>
Unf=<br>
ortunately, it plugs symbol in whenever a constant<br>
has that value, too, eve=<br>
n if it is just coincidence.<br>
Makes for some odd looking disassembled code=<br>
in places!<br>
<br>
There are some new commands relating to symbols, I don't<br>
thin=<br>
k they are documented anywhere yet (but I need to<br>
hit the sack now).<br>
