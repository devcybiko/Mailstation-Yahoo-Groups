I have done much, though.  Kind of burned out I guess.  It does<br>

There would be less work to do to just develop code directly on real<br>
hardware, given the existence of Mailbug, Z80 assemblers, C compilers<br>
(like SDCC), etc. You would need to adapt the standard library to<br>
mailstation but that's less work than having to reverse engineer and<br>
document every component in the mailstation which is what would be<br>
needed to make an emulator.<br>
<br>
That said there are already CP/M emulators around which can run raw<br>
Z80 code, so you could do testing for large swaths of code in a CP/M<br>
environment.<br>
<br>
Anyway it's more fun to develop on "the real thing." At least that's<br>
my bias as an embedded systems developer. WIth mailbug you're doing<br>
"target debugging" anyway, so you get the advantages of working on a<br>
desktop while testing code on a real Mailstation.<br>
