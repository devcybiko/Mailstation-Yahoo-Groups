Just kidding. It's a welcome change the only other thing from this list<br>
in months is a spam mail.<br>
<br>
One of these days I'll get back to the mailstation. Cyrano Jones, if<br>
you're out there, are you happily loading firmware over the parallel<br>
port yet?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">I made a version of my remote debugger, and flashed it<br>
into an unmodified mailstation.  Breakpoints do not work (yet)<br>
with this version.  I have been hammering on the PC half of<br>
the software, trying to get it into a presentable form.<br>
<br>
The reflashing protocol that I posted a while ago seems to<br>
work!  As far as any "new" code, all I have done is poke a<br>
short routine into ram via debugger (hex edit), and<br>
execute it.  It reads a key from keyboard, stores the<br>
scan code in ram, and turns on the mail LED.  :-)<br>
<br>
I have not found any way (yet) to save the existing code<br>
to disk before reflashing.  That means that you have to<br>
wipe out most of the mailstation code when you flash<br>
the remote debug code.  You even have to wipe out the<br>
font data, so I haven't done any output to LCD yet.<br>
No "Hello world" yet.   :-(<br>
<br>
It is probably gonna be "easy" to use the LCD code from<br>
the reflash routines, I just have not got 'round to it yet.<br>
I have not been able to play with this project as much as I<br>
would like to lately.<br>
<br>
If I post pascal code (compiles with Freepascal), is anyone<br>
here gonna be able to use it?  Or should I post binary???<br>
And does anyone know where the summer went????<br>

So you're saying you haven't found any "read block" command? That's a<br>
bummer. Certainly manageable given we're replacing it anyway and someone<br>
already has provided an image, but it would be nice to be able to get an<br>
backup of any given mailstation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know that feels...<br>
<br>

My Pascal knowledge is rusty but certainly workable. If you want to put<br>
the code under open source license I could get us a SourceForge project<br>
set up.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">If you use the native reflash function, it will erase the<br>
old code before you can flash any new "download" code into<br>
the code rom.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to get any code into ram, let alone how<br>
to make the mailstation execute it if you did.<br>
<br>
There is the possibility of loading code into the dataflash,<br>
but so far the only way I can think of to get it to execute<br>
it would require minor surgery on the pc board.<br>
<br>
The existence of the 2.53yr rom dump makes dumping the code<br>
an academic exercise, for the brown mailstations at least.<br>
<br>
The ergonomic case models have a different keyboard layout,<br>
so I would guess that you would not want to flash the 2.53yr<br>
code into one of those (assuming that the key matrix is<br>
different, too).<br>
<br>
Until someone rewrites all the functionality that is in the<br>
original rom (keyboard scanning, LCD display, flash filesystems,<br>
modem driver, etc., etc.), reusing the original code seems<br>
like a real good idea.<br>
<br>
I had hoped that it would be possible to reuse that code,<br>
WITHOUT the need to download it from some BBS somewhere.<br>
But I have noticed that the word "copyright" does not seem<br>
to be found anywhere in the code, so perhaps it is not as<br>
important as I thought???<br>
<br>
One of the things on my "To Do List" is to make a version<br>
of the debug code that can be overlaid on the 2.53yr dump,<br>
and then reflashed, but it would probably only work on the<br>
brown (version 2.somethin) models.<br>

It's all home-grown stuff.  And kinda ugly in some respects.<br>
I never really set out to create what I have now, it just<br>
kind of grew.  And it shows!<br>

I do plan to put it up here, under some sort of open licence.<br>
I think I would prefer to post it as source, so I don't have<br>
to worry about virus issues.  And maybe someone will want to<br>
port it to another language?  I'm not big on c, but I have<br>
thought about re-doing it in perl myself.<br>
<br>
The reason it is in Pascal is that it grew out of a program<br>
I wrote a long time ago, to poke around inside of the arcade<br>
Pacman code.  It seemed easier at the time (when I started<br>
messing with the mailstation) to just extend the old code.<br>
