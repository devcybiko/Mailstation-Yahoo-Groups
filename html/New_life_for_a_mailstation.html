<p class="formattedBody">Since these are showing up everywhere, has anyone though of<br>
reprogramming them into a functional PC assistant type device?<br>
What I think would be workable might be<br>
1 keep the flash update facility.<br>
2 keep basic email ability<br>
3 dump the spell checker and add some sort of programming facility.<br>
4 add parallel port data exchange drivers and support for a simple<br>
terminal emulation.<br>
<br>
What would be good would be something of the functionality of one of<br>
the alphasmart laptops. Mailstations have a much faster processor and<br>
much more memory than the old tandy 100s and there is still a market<br>
for the tandy laptops.<br>

If you can program in z80 assembler, "we have the technology".<br>
We just need some code now...<br>
<br>
<br>
There are at least 9 pages of 16k each available, without dumping<br>
anything (except the out of date tv listings, etc.).  But I agree,<br>
the spell checker is useless, and that is at least another page or<br>
three.<br>
<br>
After loafing for several weeks, I've got back to looking<br>
at this project, and made a lot of progress figuring out<br>
how to integrate new apps into existing mailstation firmware.<br>
<br>
I also have figured out how to dump the rom before erasing it.  :-)<br>
(I started typing it up last night, but conked out before I<br>
could post it.)<br>
<br>
It turns out that you can add the "Yahoo" type of app to<br>
*all* the mailstations, whether they have the yahoo/mycidco<br>
menu item or not.  They show up as icons after "settings"<br>
if there is no yahoo folder!<br>
<br>
By yahoo type of app, I mean adding code that takes the<br>
place of the yahoo data.  I am not talking about adding<br>
tv listings or weather or news.  The yahoo data is stored<br>
as an executable program, and this program can be anything<br>
you want (given that somebody writes the code).<br>

A good first step would be to port the SDCC Z80 target "standard<br>
library" to work with the debugger loader.<br>
<br>
My intent is to finish my port of CamelForth to MS... probably a day's<br>
work, but it's just one of a list of projects I have going at the<br>
moment.<br>

I'm not sure I understand...  Do you mean work with<br>
as far as console i/o?  Or loading?<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to it!<br>

Both. sdcc already has a z80 target, But to do a simple program like<br>
hello world someone needs to create an init and connect to whatever low<br>
level i/o routines we have available.<br>
<br>
<br>
It wasn't too hard to port to WP-2, another z80 laptop. Three or four<br>
little subroutines to port, and you can start testing high level forth<br>
code interactively at the prompt.<br>
