<p class="formattedBody">I just found this group. Nearly three years ago, I teamed<br>
up with another guy somewhere out on the net to disassemble<br>
the flash. We both worked on it fairly intensively for a couple<br>
of weeks before we both got distracted away from the project.<br>
<br>
We made a lot of progress, with nearly all of the first 16k<br>
commented and understood. We located the various application<br>
programs as well. The one thing we never figured out, though,<br>
was the condition necessary to make the unit enter the flash<br>
reprogramming section.<br>
<br>
I just went through my files and emails, but unfortunately<br>
all the work and email correspondence got lost over the years.<br>
All I have left is the disassembly I had prior to those weeks.<br>
Some of our discoveries were posted to the linuxhacker mailstation<br>
area.<br>
<br>
BTW, the code was obviously written in C and the code for<br>
the various libraries obvious as you delve into the source.<br>
<br>
It's hard to believe people have been working on this for so<br>
long and still haven't figured out how to make it enter the<br>
bootloader.<br>

Probably hard to believe because it isn't true any more ;-)<br>
<br>
There is Pascal code that 'Cyrano Jones' wrote which can flash new code<br>
over the parallel port. He has used it to put a debug monitor program<br>
on.<br>
<br>
The one thing we don't have on that score is a way to read the existing<br>
bootloader out before overwriting it.<br>
<br>
I just got my laplink cable out yesterday, I want to do a little hacking<br>
on mailstation again soon. My first goal is to get a Forth system<br>
running on it using CJs code.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if the CPU has a serial port? I think it would be a<br>
cool hack to rewire the phone port (or both ports together if one wants<br>
flow control) as a serial port. Then with an external Y cable that<br>
connects into both and from there to a cable or adapter. This would make<br>
the machine much more easily interfaced with other computers, and would<br>
probably spur some interest as a portable terminal.<br>
