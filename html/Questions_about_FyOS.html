I was reading your livejournal and am impressed :-) bu=<br>

<br>
From what you've written, they don't seem totally impossible. I =<br>
really<br>
like the idea of using a MS like this:<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jtsystem.ca/touch=">(URL)</a><br>
amp.htm<br>
<br>
Of course, I know that the Palm OS has a lot more memory available=<br>
but<br>
the serial connection to the WinAmp machine is cool.<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing =<br>
that I've always thought would make the MS useable as is, if<br>
I could use a =<br>
null modem connection to put any text I'd written onto<br>
my main pc.  You see=<br>
m to be able to talk to the unit, so is that<br>
something you could document h=<br>
ow to do?  I do have an old external<br>
modem and null modem adapter.  I even =<br>
have an ancient parallel port<br>
external hard drive that I could dig out and =<br>
use.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for sharing all your work!<br>

<br>
Well if I could put a=<br>
ctual CP/M on it, there'd be lots of<br>
applications that could be run native=<br>
ly.  The problem is the memory<br>
layout of the Mailstation, and how CP/M and=<br>
applications compiled for<br>
it expect a slightly different memory layout.  =<br>
Changing it would<br>
require a hardware modification to the unit, which is pr=<br>
obably above<br>
the head of most casual Mailstation modders.  Possibly above =<br>
mine as<br>
well, considering the small traces on the board involved in doing =<br>
it!<br>
<br>
That's pretty much why I was working on FyOS, which would be similar<br>
=<br>
to CP/M, but unfortunately not be compatible with its applications.<br>
Possi=<br>
ble exceptions might be in cases where the source code to one<br>
might be ava=<br>
ilable and easily modifiable.  Ones without source just<br>
seem too hard to d=<br>
o anything with.  I tried to decompile and modify<br>
Zork, for example, but o=<br>
nce I started going into the assembly code<br>
and realizing just what a job t=<br>
hat would be, just for one program, I<br>
found it just wasn't viable.  I was =<br>
having to completely learn what<br>
every bit of the code did before I could e=<br>
ven begin modifying it, and<br>
considering it was all in assembly, that's a b=<br>
it hard.<br>
<br>
Most applications for FyOS would probably have to be written by m=<br>
e or<br>
someone else who learned the ins and outs.  But since I figured out<br>
=<br>
how to compile things in C for it, there might be a few folks who<br>
could do=<br>
it once I had a better version of FyOS out.  When I last<br>
worked on it, I =<br>
was still at the stage of developing a storage<br>
method, which would be a pr=<br>
etty important part to being able to have<br>
applications on there.  At the m=<br>
oment, people can write programs in C<br>
with what I've done so far, but they=<br>
'd still have to be transferred<br>
individually.<br>
<br>
You made some pretty good s=<br>
uggestions though of the sorts of programs<br>
that I too would like to see.  =<br>
One being something like a PDA<br>
keyboard, since I type pretty quick on the =<br>
PC, and it's extremely<br>
limiting to try and peck stuff out on a PDA screen'=<br>
s keyboard.  I<br>
think my Palm would be a much more useful tool if I could u=<br>
se the<br>
Mailstation to type stuff into it.<br>
<br>
The other good suggestion is =<br>
the dumb terminal.  I run one particular<br>
server completely headless, and i=<br>
t would be handy to be able to<br>
interface it directly without having to SSH=<br>
in from elsewhere at<br>
times.  I also have one of those Fonera router thing=<br>
s which runs<br>
Linux, and think it would be neat to interface the Mailstatio=<br>
n with<br>
it, giving the Fonera (which has wifi) a keyboard and screen to wor=<br>
k<br>
with.  With a battery pack, the Fonera could be mobile, since it's so<br>
s=<br>
mall.<br>
<br>
The problem with making any sort of serial connection though is the =<br>
<br>
lack of a serial port.  The Mailstation uses a modem chip, which<br>
unfortun=<br>
ately directly outputs to a phone line.  I haven't looked<br>
over the datashe=<br>
et for the chip very thoroughly, so I don't know if<br>
it might have any pins=<br>
to tap into the serial port of it directly,<br>
but even if one could, solder=<br>
ing onto those pins would be extremely<br>
tricky.  The other alternative is u=<br>
sing the parallel port of the<br>
Mailstation to emulate a serial port, which =<br>
would require very<br>
precise programming to time the speed of a serial data.=<br>
It would<br>
probably also require a bit of hardware to be plugged between t=<br>
he MS<br>
and PC, to convert the signals from the parallel port into the<br>
volt=<br>
ages that a serial port wants.  I've managed to get away without<br>
such conv=<br>
ersions in the past on other projects, but that only worked<br>
when talking t=<br>
o my laptop's serial port, and not on my desktop<br>
machine.<br>
<br>
I have kind of =<br>
made a dumb terminal to my PC before in a way, by<br>
writing some software to=<br>
send keystrokes to the computer, then send<br>
them to an IRC chat room, and =<br>
then send any output from chat back to<br>
the Mailstation screen.  This was a=<br>
ll done through the parallel<br>
laplink cable though that I use to load FyOS.=<br>
One could probably do<br>
something similar with a Linux machine for an actu=<br>
al terminal, but it<br>
wouldn't be as simple to setup as just a serial connec=<br>
tion.<br>
<br>
But yeah, I think perhaps trying to emulate the serial port is<br>
prob=<br>
ably something good to try sometime.  With that, it would open up<br>
a few po=<br>
ssibilities in general.  I'm just not sure if I have any of<br>
the chips arou=<br>
nd to do the serial conversion at the moment for<br>
testing.<br>

on without having to do this, and I think that's a good<br>
idea.  I had also =<br>

handy for writing stuff on.=<br>
So the next thing I work on will<br>
probably be a way to just download all =<br>
the email off the unit via the<br>
parallel laplink cable, which would be a lo=<br>

modem connection stuff.  I doubt it'll be hard, i=<br>
t's just a matter of<br>
diving back into all that Mailstation code again!<br>

My thinking is to use this as a dumb data terminal in =<br>

<br>
re you able to find out what the internal modem had for<br>

<br>
Different model Mailstations appear to have different=<br>
modem speeds.<br>
There's a list in the Database section of the group here. =<br>
The one<br>
mine uses though is 33.6kbps, using the chip RCV336ACFW/SP.  Ther=<br>
e's<br>
a datasheet for it in the Files section here, in the "part files"<br>
dir=<br>
ectory, if you understand electronics enough to look over it.  I<br>
would ass=<br>
ume it defaults to 8-N-1 parity, but I have no idea.  I've<br>
never written a=<br>
ny code to access it myself as of this time.<br>
<br>
on the serial/parallel port that could be<br>
used<br>
when the modem goes into transmit mode ??<br>
as a dumb data terminal in a mobile<br>
sense,<br>
io units.<br>
<br>
The modem chip itself might activate some pins when it's usin=<br>
g the<br>
modem, but I haven't read the datasheet in any detail to know.  It'd=<br>
<br>
be hard to take advantage of that anyway since the pins are so tiny<br>
on t=<br>
hat chip.<br>
<br>
That's an interesting concept though.  I honestly have never w=<br>
orked<br>
with any sort of half-duplex audio equipment with a data connection,=<br>
<br>
but I assume it can be done.  I don't think a standard modem would<br>
work,=<br>
however, since as far as I know, it requires full-duplex,<br>
particularly to=<br>
negotiate the connection, but to maintain it as well.<br>
<br>
The only thing I ca=<br>
n figure that you could do would be to use some<br>
sort of external hardware =<br>
to modulate data into something that could<br>
transmit via audio, and use the=<br>
Mailstation's parallel port to talk<br>
to that device.  Not exactly what you=<br>
had in mind I guess, but that's<br>
the only way I can figure that it could b=<br>
e done.  I don't know enough<br>
about that sort of thing to know what sort of=<br>
device you'd need for<br>
it.<br>
