Part of the problem is the mailstation uses the "Control X" (Xtnd) character<br>
in it's<br>
email sequences.  Most email services will not except that as part of the<br>
login,<br>
and handshakes for email delivery.<br>
<br>
Somebody probably could setup an email server that would work with this, but<br>
they would have to overcome 2 questions ??<br>
<br>
1. Would using this particular email protocol be infringing on Earthlink's<br>
patent?<br>
And would they then get into a lawsuit from Earthlink over using it ?<br>
<br>
2. How would they pay for the 800 number dial-up telephone lines to access<br>
the system ???<br>
You want the service for "FREE", but somebody has to pay for the facilities<br>
somehow ???<br>
Would you except SPAM delivered to you, with the money paid for that<br>
advertising to pay<br>
for the facilities ???  Or would you be willing to pay a monthly fee for the<br>
email service ??<br>
<br>
An 800 number would run about 5 cents per minute, with 2 calls per day from<br>
the Mailstation,<br>
about 2 minutes each, that is about $ 3.00 per month, plus the cost of<br>
running the server unit,<br>
the electric, and providing any accounting staff to handle your payments.  I<br>
would say that<br>
you would need about $ 5.00 per month to break even.<br>

Do you foresee that Earthlink is going to drop the Mailstation service,<br>
or are they going to continue providing it ??<br>
<br>
YES, it would be interesting to know about the Xntd control.  But I am sure<br>
that an email server running the "Sendmail" program could have the program<br>
changed to allow the use of the Control character if needed ??<br>
<br>
Actually at $ 9.95 per month ( $ 12.95 for model 350 units), they should be<br>
making some good profit on the<br>
service ??   There is really not much that you need to supply to provide<br>
that service, so hopefully they will<br>
keep it.   IF not, I hope that they will allow "openness" on the programming<br>
and such for the units, so they<br>
can be used for those that really NEED them.<br>
<br>
I actually am finding that more Elderly people are looking at the service,<br>
and I have put 2 units in service<br>
for my Elderly relatives.  Since these people have not grown up among<br>
computers like we have, they are<br>
"Computer literate", and are afraid of using a regular computer for email<br>
service.  But since they have used<br>
a typewriter in their lifetime, the "Mailstation" is manageable for them !<br>
<br>
I know that both my relatives were hesitant at first, but you would have to<br>
break their arms to get their<br>
Mailstations away from them now !!<br>
<br>
Just wish I could find another Model 350 that worked good, or figure out why<br>
this one I have won't switch<br>
over to the correct account.  The Model 350 is so much nicer to use !!!<br>

1. The answer is no , I have come accross mailstations that had both<br>
"Xtnd: OFF" as well as "Xtnd:ON" . On that note i really dont think it<br>
matters. I could look further into this if you guys wish.<br>

Part of the problem is the mailstation uses the "Control X" (Xtnd)<br>
character in it's<br>
email sequences.  Most email services will not except that as part of<br>
the login,<br>
and handshakes for email delivery.<br>
<br>
Somebody probably could setup an email server that would work with this,<br>
but<br>
they would have to overcome 2 questions ??<br>
<br>
1. Would using this particular email protocol be infringing on<br>
Earthlink's patent?<br>
And would they then get into a lawsuit from Earthlink over using it ?<br>
<br>
2. How would they pay for the 800 number dial-up telephone lines to<br>
access the system ???<br>
You want the service for "FREE", but somebody has to pay for the<br>
facilities somehow ???<br>
Would you except SPAM delivered to you, with the money paid for that<br>
advertising to pay<br>
for the facilities ???  Or would you be willing to pay a monthly fee for<br>
the email service ??<br>
<br>
An 800 number would run about 5 cents per minute, with 2 calls per day<br>
from the Mailstation,<br>
about 2 minutes each, that is about $ 3.00 per month, plus the cost of<br>
running the server unit,<br>
the electric, and providing any accounting staff to handle your<br>
payments.  I would say that<br>
you would need about $ 5.00 per month to break even.<br>

Subject: [mailstation] Dialup Access<br>
<br>
1)<br>
My wife just picked up a DET1 v2.55Y at a garage sale this weekend<br>
for $2 and I've been trying to get it to work. I was able to reset<br>
it and enter new info, but could only create one user account. Is<br>
there a way to create additional users without calling EarthLink?<br>
<br>
2)<br>
I found a dialup ISP, www.bamnet.com, that has local dialup service<br>
in the small town where an elderly aunt lives in Upper Michigan.<br>
They charge only one cent per minute with a prepaid account. With<br>
thousands of dial up numbers around the country, this looks like a<br>
great option. I cannot get my email from my ISP once I am logged<br>
into the internet, but I can use my company's email server to<br>
receive messages, but not to send. I am currently setting up a test<br>
Windows 2003 server for pop3 and smtp access and will experiment<br>
with that here shortly.<br>
<br>
3)<br>
With great dialup access to the internet, wouldn't it be feasible<br>
for someone to host a simple pop3/smtp server for use for<br>
MailStation type of appliances? I realize protections are needed to<br>
keep the spammers off, but that should be easy by limiting these<br>
accounts to minimal settings needed for dialup and only a few<br>
messages at a time, I would think. Does this sound reasonable to<br>
you? If so, then why hasn't somebody done it?<br>
<br>
4)<br>
Are there any more of the free dialup ISPs left, or dialup email<br>
providers? All of the big providers are having to lock down their<br>
systems, charge for services, and create roadblocks that these<br>
simple little mail terminals can't seem to handle without a major<br>
effort to rewrite code and rewrite the PROMs.<br>
<br>
5)<br>
Do you think providing this type of service, particularly for the<br>
elderly and perhaps specialty markets like RVers would be feasible?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
PS If I can get everything to work I will be happy to publish all<br>
the info I find, and about Bamnet, if you think it would be useful<br>
to anybody on this group.<br>
