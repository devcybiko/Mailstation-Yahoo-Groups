<p class="formattedBody">Okay, I'm back with another question. Assistance pliz.<br>
<br>
I got through getting my own account set up okay (with my local<br>
ISP...he was sitting in the room while I set it up...we didn't have<br>
problems). I set up an account for my son (with NetZero), who will be<br>
the eventual recipient of the test machine. I filled out the material<br>
on the question screen (with appropriate x's where I don't want to<br>
say):<br>
==<br>
User Name: xxx<br>
Dial-Up No: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Reply-To: xxx@...<br>
E-Mail Address xxx@...<br>
E-mail Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
POP3 Server: pop.netzero.net<br>
SMTP Server: smtp.netzero.net<br>
ISP Account: xxx<br>
ISP Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Primary DNS: 0.0.0.0<br>
==<br>
I dial up the long distance number (there aren't any local to Ganado<br>
TX &lt;G>) and get the obvious modem sounds, logging on report, then it<br>
hangs up and says that the service is unavailable or busy.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is busy. I'm concerned that I don't know the DNS<br>
numbers to plug in above. (Do I need them?)<br>
I'm also concerned that I just used the email prefix (in my case just<br>
three letters where I've shown xxx above) for the ISP Account and User<br>
Name information should go.<br>
<br>
Are these correct? I'm in the dark and can't really ask the free ISP<br>
any questions. Has anyone here actually set up a free NetZero account<br>
and been successful? If so, PLEASE help me out.<br>
<br>
Trying desperately to get my adult son to communicate frequently by<br>
email, as I know he leads a busy life and doesn't always just sit by<br>
the phone for my calls. &lt;g><br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

them. So I think you need to put one.<br>

Until you find it, you can try replacing the DNS names the actual IP<br>
addresses for the pop and smtp servers:<br>
<br>
smtp.netzero.net 64.136.29.92<br>
pop.netzero.net  64.136.28.166<br>

You do need the DNS numbers for the Mailstation to work.  You should be<br>
able to determine them by normally logging onto NetZero with your PC.<br>
Then, while logged on, run IPCONFIG on the PC.  The data that then<br>
appears on your screen should include the DNS number for NetZero.  This<br>
should work unless NetZero is providing a "dynamic" DNS, which changes<br>
each time you log in..<br>
<br>
Also, the ISP account and password should be the same as the email<br>
address and password, since you have only one account with NetZero.<br>
<br>
Also, be aware that Mailstation is limited to 8k bytes per email.<br>
Consequently, no images--just text.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  If you need additional info, email me back, or contact<br>
Curt-W4QBU (we both have Mailstation 120s).<br>

John, et al:<br>
<br>
I'm gonna have to quit doing stuff in the middle of the night with no<br>
sleep. ;)<br>
<br>
I REALLY signed him up with Juno.com instead of NetZero.net. &lt;sigh><br>
I tried to follow your instructions, but got no results. Here's what I<br>
did:<br>
1. I fixed the account setup in the MailStation from NetZero to Juno,<br>
though I didn't know I'd have to erase all I had in there to do so.<br>
It now reads:<br>
==<br>
User Name: xxx<br>
Dial-Up No: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Reply-To: xxx@n...<br>
E-Mail Address xxx@n...<br>
E-mail Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
POP3 Server: pop.juno.com<br>
SMTP Server: smtp.juno.com<br>
ISP Account: xxx<br>
ISP Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Primary DNS: 0.0.0.0<br>
==<br>
<br>
2. I tried to get the DNS entry for the POP3 server at Juno.com from<br>
your instructions: I printed the results before connecting to Juno.com<br>
and after and they didn't vary. I am using DSL with a WiFi<br>
modem/router. I guess the command can't get through the router beyond<br>
my ISP's DNS address. ?? Maybe someone else can get the address for<br>
me. Sorry that I am unable to comply here. Lack of knowledge excels.<br>
;)<br>
<br>
3. I filled in the info as shown above and tried to send a test<br>
message with the same results. Now it is possible that the thing is<br>
actually busy, but the other time I tried it was VERY late at night.<br>
This time it is mid-morning in Austin, where I'm calling to. Another<br>
reason I don't think it is busy is that the device said it was<br>
"Logging In" and the bar graph went across and the modem shut up like<br>
it had actually connected and gotten beyond the handshaking stage.<br>
<br>
I'm tapping my fingers on the keys and trying to have patience. It has<br>
just been many years since I've actually had to mess with the vagaries<br>
and frustrations of modem comms. &lt;g> First, cable modem, then DSL have<br>
both really spoiled me to just being confident that I can just march<br>
in here and &lt;zip> the machine is connected.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your help and patience.<br>

Well the IP addresses I gave will probably only work for the service you<br>
signed up for, so ignore the previous IP addresses.<br>
<br>
To get the DNS entry for Juno you can follow Milt's instructions. Just<br>
follow their instructions to get it to log in to juno from windows, and<br>
then run either ipconfig from command prompt (under Windows NT, W2K, or<br>
XP) or winipcfg from Windows 95, 98 or ME. This will give you the DNS<br>
address. If you have the DNS address you don't need to resolve the smtp<br>
and pop addresses by hand.<br>
<br>
The point of this is, smtp.juno.com and pop.juno.com are DNS names. For<br>
the mailstation to be able to send (smtp) or receive (pop) mail, it will<br>
have to talk to actual servers and their actual IP addresses.<br>
smtp.juno.com and pop.juno.com are not IP addresses. They are DNS names,<br>
and normally can be traded in to the DNS server for IP addresses. But in<br>
the example above, your DNS server IP is 0.0.0.0 so there is no chance<br>
of sending mail in this configuration.<br>
<br>
Now it is possible that the Mailstation could talk to the smtp server<br>
and pop server if it has the raw IP addresses. But it might not. Best<br>
thing is to put the DNS IP. Second best is to try again with JUNO's mail<br>
server addresses.<br>
<br>
If you just want to do a test without the DNS number, you might try<br>
resolving the pop.juno.com and smtp.juno.com on your desktop PC. Just<br>
open a ms-dos prompt and type<br>
<br>
ping pop.juno.com<br>
<br>
that will give you their pop Ip address<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
ping smtp.juno.com<br>
<br>
I got:<br>
<br>
PING pop.juno.com (64.136.20.167): 56 data bytes<br>
...<br>
PING smtp.juno.com (64.136.21.93): 56 data bytes<br>
...<br>

I suspect neither NetZero nor Juno will work. I used NetZero for a while,<br>
but it needed a Windows computer so it could put it's banner on the screen.<br>
Also, it was very difficult to get on as even if you had unused time there<br>
was some sort of limit on how many free users could be on the service at<br>
once. YMMV.<br>

I'd look around locally for a cheap dial up ISP and make your best deal. If<br>
you tell them you need 5 minutes per day max for email only they may make<br>
you a good offer.<br>

John H. replies today:<br>
<br>
John,<br>
<br>
Using both your values for the DNS, entered one at a time netted me<br>
zero results different from last time.<br>
<br>
I did find an additional error pointed out to me by the firmware: the<br>
user name I entered was erroneously entered by me as the email<br>
address. The firmware notified me to take out the @ and try again. I<br>
just put in my son's name this time.<br>
<br>
Still no worky.<br>
<br>
I'm still appealing to someone who has had a free service work for<br>
them with a Mailstation to get back with me here and tell me what you<br>
did. Several folks said in the last month or so that they were going<br>
to try a free service. Where are they? Hayelp.<br>
<br>
John, the one problem I have with entering the two numbers is that I<br>
don't know which to use or if there is supposed to be some general DNS<br>
address entered. Obviously, neither works okay for Juno. &lt;sigh><br>
<br>
I'm close to wit's end.<br>
<br>
Maybe I should try another service?<br>

No, I didn't give you a DNS IP address. Both of those are mail server<br>
addresses. You need to replace each mail server with the associated<br>
address.<br>
<br>
Where you have configured pop.juno.com instead try 64.136.20.167<br>
<br>
Where you have configured smtp.juno.com instead try 64.136.21.93<br>

<br>
Gotta get it all right at once.<br>
<br>
<br>
You just have to follow directions ;-)  And I need to learn to give<br>
better ones.<br>
<br>
Now, as I said Milt may be giving you better advice here: just get the<br>
actual DNS address! To do this, you need to connect to Juno from a<br>
Windows desktop as he described. Then you can find out from Windows what<br>
the DNS server IP address after you connect to it.<br>
<br>
Juno, netzero etc. may or may not work. But the MS probably does require<br>
a valid DNS address, so until you've done a valid test with all<br>
necessary parameters there's no reason to give up.<br>

As I reported earlier today, I do not seem to be able to do the<br>

Hmm... are you dialing up from your machine?<br>

What OS are you running?<br>
<br>
You need to<br>
<br>
a) Connect to Juno via dialup<br>
b) Run winipcfg (Win98) or ipconfig (NT)<br>
c) Look for your dial up adapter... it will either be in the dump<br>

You should be able to find the DNS name there.<br>

OK, I was able to set up an account and connect to Juno from my laptop.<br>
The DNS servers for Juno are 64.136.20.120 and 64.136.28.120<br>
<br>
Unfortunately though I cannot get a MS (Black DET-1) to send or receive<br>
mail through Juno. It dials, but gives the same error that you<br>
described.<br>
<br>
Now, I connected again to Juno, and set up Outlook Express to collect<br>
mail. The only thing I can get from Juno is an initial message that<br>
<br>
"Access to Juno email using an off-line email program, such as Outlook<br>
Express, is not available to Free members."<br>
<br>
Since the MS can't use a webmail facility, there is no way to make use<br>
of Juno with the Free account.  Is that what you're using? If so, I<br>
think you'll need to find another service, and probably have to pay a<br>
little bit. Or you could use Juno, but you have to sign for one of the<br>
paid accounts. But I don't see much point to that... you are better off<br>
finding a low price provider on the web.<br>
<br>
That said, if you pay a little bit it's more likely they'll be willing<br>
to help you get the thing set up.<br>
