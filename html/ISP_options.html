<p class="formattedBody">You need a dial up service which offers POP/SMTP mail. Juno/NetZero offers<br>
"Free Internet Access and Email" for 10 hours each month however it may be<br>
that this system won't work except on a PC.<br>
<br>
If you only use it for a MailStation this should be plenty since you'll run<br>
about 3 minutes per day.<br>

Now that I have blank fields, I've been looking for a email service. Any<br>
suggestions? Thanks. And keep it as simple and stupid as possible...as I've<br>
read the various posts I see there are people in this group<br>
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more advanced than I on this whole thing. As I've tried<br>
to do the research myself I can't figure out which email services will work<br>
and which won't. I think I'm smart enough to know that the 'web based' ones<br>
won't. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.<br>
