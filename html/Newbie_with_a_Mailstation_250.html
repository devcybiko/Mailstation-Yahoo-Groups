<p class="formattedBody">Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a Mailstation 250 (model DET2B, firmware V1.12 XTND:ON) that<br>
isn't taking kindly to my adventures in repurposing.  I have tried every<br>
key combination I can think of, but the only promising sign I get is a<br>
"Scanning Memory Data..." progress bar on startup with a menu to reset<br>
system data.  It seems I'm not much of a hardware hacker...can anyone<br>
out there give me some hints on what I'm doing wrong? A step-by-step<br>
guide or FAQ for this model would also be a great help for any n00bs<br>
like myself who came along.  Thanks for reading! :)<br>
