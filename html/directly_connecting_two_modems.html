Why would you need a winmodem? Actually, there are drivers for some<br>
winmodems for Linux machines. Some of these modems are interesting in<br>
that they can act as an FXO allowing you to connect a Linux box running<br>
Asterisk to a regular phone line.<br>
<br>
This article gives some hope that you can just connect two modems<br>
together with a regular phone cable.<br>

ATA on the host and let MS dial in.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I just tried this with a MS150 and a rockwell external<br>
modem, no workey.<br>
<br>
Typed ATA in terminal on rockwell side, and hit Get Email on MS. I had<br>
to configure the mailstation to "ignore dial tone" but that just kept it<br>
from timing it out. No connection is established.<br>
<br>
Could it be configuration on modem side? Anyone have any ideas?<br>

<p class="formattedBody">Some modems are line-powered. They use the phone line<br>
to power the part of the modem circuitry. Connecting a<br>
cross-over phone cable between a line-powered modem<br>
and another modem, it won't work because the<br>
line-powered modem won't have enough voltage to<br>
operate. Line-powered modems are common in portable<br>
devices and can be spotted by a REN (Ringer<br>
Equivalency Number) of more than 0. Most phone<br>
companies allow 2 REN. The phone lines use between 24<br>
and 48 volts.<br>
<br>
A winmodem on the other hand is an imcomplete modem<br>
with most of the higher-level functions (like<br>
compression and dialing ) handed off to  a software<br>
driver. Winmodems are cheaper to manufacture, and can<br>
be upgraded by changing a driver. And the drivers are<br>
buound by trade secret agreements with Microsoft which<br>
give Microsoft dominion over who is allowed to use the<br>
modem.<br>
if you have 2 phone lines at home, you can run a bbs<br>
program on you PC, call the pc from the ms on the<br>
other line and should be able to quickly work out the<br>
signon dialogue, and simulate it on the PC. Ther is a<br>
simple free BBS program called AddBBS that is written<br>
in perl. Also perl is available free of charge for<br>
almost every OS in existance.<br>
