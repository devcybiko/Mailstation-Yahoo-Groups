<p class="formattedBody">This setup menu looks quite similar to the "mailstation setup"<br>
menu that is accessible under the normal mode main menu item<br>
"setup", then "mailstation".  Except for the erased account<br>
info, that is.<br>
<br>
Neither of the two will let you enter/change the email address.<br>
<br>
To get out of the infinite loop of it insisting I fill in<br>
"all the items", but not letting me enter one of them, I<br>
reset to factory settings again (and let it finish this time).<br>

seems as if the email address may be changed by a mime message sent to<br>
the reset mailstation's default address.<br>

<p class="formattedBody">It seemed from that thread there was some kind of encryption key.<br>
<br>
Not that it can't be cracked... The question is if anyone the the skill<br>
to do so wishes to look at it (I am no crypto expert).<br>
<br>
If experience holds, they probably are only doing an encoding, and not<br>
real encryption, but they could be.<br>
<br>
Has anyone looked around for the email maintenance routines?<br>
