<p class="formattedBody">I, too, couldn't pass up a $9.00 MS120. I bought it not to hack, but<br>
to give to my Dad. My concern is that it can't handle HTML, which is<br>
how nearly everyone sends stuff nowadays, even when they don't need<br>
it. Are the HTML markups stripped, or does all the ugly HTML code show<br>
up? If that's the case I won't spend the money to sign up for the serivce.<br>

The service may strip the HTML but the machine won't. The service may be<br>
rather expensive and I'm not sure how long it will be available. However a<br>
lot of the USA doesn't have high speed access so for now ...<br>
