Let me get to the point.  I can get into the edit mode of<br>
the hex viewer=<br>
.  As I understand it, what i'm looking at is all user<br>
mem and not ROM.  B=<br>
ut the ROM is flashable.  And there are<br>
instructions already in place to d=<br>
o it.  And you can enter your own<br>
apps by hand in hex and run them in the =<br>
yahoo! feature or wherever.<br>
All I want to do in turn XTND off or at least=<br>
change the strings to<br>
something else the POP3 server wont puke on (-ERR).=<br>
0C1D30 in the rom<br>
is what I'm looking to change. 0C1C70, AND 0C1DB0 as w=<br>
ell.  06bab0 has<br>
a couple of strings but thats all they are for what I kno=<br>
w.  So<br>
basically what I want to do is change XTND to something that wont<br>
=<br>
return -ERR on most POP3 servers, and I want to do it without flashing<br>
the=<br>
ROM externally.  I am more than willing to enter hex for a few<br>
hours to m=<br>
ake it work.  Maybe someone will write an editor for the rom<br>
someday.  Any=<br>
idea's anyone?<br>

as I know,<br>
it is not a Rabbit part.<br>
<br>
In my personal opinion, it is a cu=<br>
stom ASIC.<br>
<br>
But there is a built-in reflash function, in *software*.<br>
One =<br>
of the things that my "mailbug" debugger does is<br>
interface with this nativ=<br>
e reflash capability<br>
(via parallel port & laplink cable), allowing you to =<br>
<br>
re-program the mailstations codeflash.<br>
<br>
So far, the only thing *I* have fl=<br>
ashed in any of my<br>
mailstations is code that lets me boot up the remote<br>
d=<br>
ebugger.  But it can be used to flash whatever you want.<br>
Ferinstince, if so=<br>
meone was inclined to write completely<br>
new firmware, mailbug can flash it =<br>
into a stock mailstation.<br>
Or, if you just want to make some changes to ex=<br>
isting<br>
mailstation firmware, it can reflash with your modified<br>
firmware.<br>
=<br>
<br>
I have been working (Ha!) on a new version of the boot code<br>
(code that boo=<br>
ts up the remote debug functions of mailbug)<br>
that can be used without erasi=<br>
ng the existing mailstation<br>
code.  (The native reflash erases most of the =<br>
codeflash<br>
*before* you get a chance to "back it up".)<br>
<br>
This new version wi=<br>
ll (when I get it working) let you load<br>
and execute your own code over the =<br>
laplink, without killing<br>
the existing mailstation code.  It also will let =<br>
you save<br>
to disk an intact image of your particular firmware version.<br>
<br>
Afte=<br>
r saving your firmware to a file on PC, you can edit it<br>
with whatever tools=<br>
you like, and then flash your new<br>
version back to your mailstation.<br>
<br>
If y=<br>
ou are working with mailstation firmware 2.53yr or 2.54,<br>
you can do this n=<br>
ow, with the currently posted mailbug 0.0.3.<br>
There are images of those tw=<br>
o firmware versions in the group<br>
download area.  So, for those two, you do=<br>
n't really need to<br>
save your own images.<br>
<br>
One catch, mailbug 0.0.3 will no=<br>
t let you change the first<br>
four pages of codeflash with the native reflash.=<br>
If you<br>
load the remote debug boot code, then you can flash anything<br>
anyw=<br>
here.  Mailbug 0.0.4 will flash the whole codeflash<br>
without needing to load=<br>
the remote debugger.<br>

Of the 2 that I have ( 1 120 and a 150 ) the 120 has a<br>
rabbit chip in it. It is apparently a discontinued<br>
part that was replaced by the 2000. The Rabbit 2000 is<br>
functionally similar. both are based on a Z180<br>
compatible core. I'll have to take a peek at theh<br>
150's innards and see what it has.<br>
