Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product<br>
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support<br>
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on<br>
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for<br>
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their<br>
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I<br>
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data<br>
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.<br>
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no<br>
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where<br>
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:<br>
<br>
User Name:<br>
Dial Up Number:<br>
E-mail address:<br>
E-mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SMTP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole<br>
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't<br>
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.<br>
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....<br>
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all<br>
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info<br>
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>
<br>
More later.....<br>
<br>
Please consider the environment before printing this email note.<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
back on despite<br>
That was all that was<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
service, grief and<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.<br>
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call<br>
centers sucks!!!<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>

<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>

The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,<br>
but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the<br>
only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print<br>
in color.<br>
<br>
Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more<br>
security for locking you from getting in to work on it.<br>
<br>
It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself<br>
and move to a working account. The "special" email has<br>
MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the<br>
internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.<br>
<br>
Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these<br>
characters to be received by the machine.<br>
<br>
The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the<br>
serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special<br>
encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.<br>
<br>
You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink<br>
will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,<br>
and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special characters,<br>
which you won't see or be able to print out.<br>
<br>
You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using these<br>
mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???<br>
<br>
If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until<br>
Earthlink<br>
finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to<br>
there !!!<br>
<br>
As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!<br>

<br>
Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product Life)<br>
spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support anything more<br>
than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on our own here. I just<br>
learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for bankruptcy this past January.<br>
My calls and faxes to them for their engineering assistance went unanswered<br>
and I expect the letter I posted to them a week ago will be coming back<br>
soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data are<br>
pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information. Start with<br>
'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no typos. You will<br>
most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where you'll need to type it<br>
all in just as you saw it:<br>

I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole in<br>
the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't operational.<br>
Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test. When it's done press<br>
the Reset again to get back to the Diag.... screen. Press Q to return the<br>
machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all said<br>
they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info from them<br>
to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>
<br>
More later.....<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
An update:<br>
<br>
3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned<br>
back on despite<br>
those incompetent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation.<br>
That was all that was<br>
wrong with her original unit.<br>
<br>
Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no<br>
service, grief and<br>
frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.<br>
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call<br>
centers sucks!!!<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which<br>
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.<br>

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and<br>

that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).<br>

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry<br>
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll<br>
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.<br>
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.<br>

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!<br>

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the<br>
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not<br>
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may<br>
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me<br>
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access<br>
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope<br>
you got your mom all fixed up too.<br>
<br>
Don't worry - I won't publish this anywhere, just print it out for my<br>

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product<br>
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support<br>
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on<br>
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for<br>
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their<br>
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I<br>
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data<br>
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.<br>
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no<br>
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where<br>
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:<br>
<br>
User Name:<br>
Dial Up Number:<br>
E-mail address:<br>
E-mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SMTP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole<br>
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't<br>
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.<br>
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....<br>
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all<br>
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info<br>
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>
<br>
More later.....<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
back on despite<br>
That was all that was<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
service, grief and<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.<br>
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call<br>
centers sucks!!!<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>

Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian<br>

still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.<br>
Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.<br>

Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and<br>
I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And<br>

suggested she just abandon the "bad" group, rename it something<br>

them set up any new groups, and after the tech friend and the Indians<br>
finished messing with it, NONE of the groups would work anymore and<br>
it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to<br>
all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).<br>
As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"<br>
anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old<br>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'<br>
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name<br>
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose<br>
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which<br>
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.<br>

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and<br>

function, which is what leads us to believe in the "bad flash memory<br>

that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).<br>

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry<br>
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll<br>
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.<br>
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.<br>

try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me<br>

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product<br>
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support<br>
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on<br>
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for<br>
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their<br>
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I<br>
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data<br>
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.<br>
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no<br>
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where<br>
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:<br>

E-mail address:<br>
E-mail Password:<br>
POP3 Server:<br>
SMTP Server:<br>
ISP Account:<br>
ISP Password:<br>
Primary DNS:<br>
<br>
I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six<br>
years later I needed them!<br>
<br>
Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole<br>
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.<br>
<br>
Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't<br>
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.<br>
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....<br>
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status<br>
<br>
If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please<br>
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.<br>
<br>
Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all<br>
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info<br>
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.<br>

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.<br>
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My<br>
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to<br>
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was<br>
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about<br>
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and<br>
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or<br>
replacement, they got rude.<br>
<br>
So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the<br>
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being<br>
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools<br>
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting<br>
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a<br>
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"<br>
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new<br>
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were<br>
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you<br>
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her<br>
"Thanks for nothing."<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit<br>
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.<br>
<br>
back on despite<br>
That was all that was<br>
of Earthlink's HQ<br>
service, grief and<br>
agents.<br>

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.<br>
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I<br>
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my<br>
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended<br>

2. Any Ideas about this problem?<br>
Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77<br>
Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))<br>
<br>
I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like<br>
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and<br>
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).<br>
<br>
When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's<br>
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print<br>
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail<br>
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card<br>
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it<br>
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the<br>
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd<br>
be far too easy...)<br>
<br>
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any<br>
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has<br>
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her<br>
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people<br>
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)<br>
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped<br>
for another year on the service.<br>
<br>
Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot<br>
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer<br>
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may<br>
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back<br>
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the<br>
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull<br>
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was<br>
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has<br>
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an<br>
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy<br>
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The<br>
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix<br>
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all<br>
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the<br>
Indians being involved?<br>
<br>
