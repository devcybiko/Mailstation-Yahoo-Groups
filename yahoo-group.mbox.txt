Welcome all who wish to find information about the mailstation.

This groups has been set up as a central location for technical
information. The file and photo areas were missing with other locations.

I know its been years in the coming, but Ill start off with the old
files I created of the ROM dump.

I will also include pdf files of the components I have found.

If anyone has any technical information t share, please post here and
Ill add it to the files/photos lists.

thanks

hamilton

Thanks for setting up the group and uploading the files. I am looking
forward to figuring out how the mailstation works and then 
extending it to do some other interesting things. I have several
questions, but I'll use them to start some new threads.

Thanks again,
Jim

I can think of two ethical issues related to hacking the ms, one that
I can ignore, and one that I can't.

1) I'm sure there was something in the license agreement about not
reverse engineering the ms, but I look on this as a fascinating 
puzzle. There may be so much code that I will tire of trying to
understand it before I ever do, but for now, it is a diversion. I
don't have a problem with hacking an obsolete device as a personal
challenge. Should I feel more unethical about this?

2) I'm also sure that there are some ms users who know nothing about
computers and are just thrilled to get an email from a dear 
friend. I have a big problem with contributing to their frustration
and disillusionment when someone figures out how to craft an email 
that will change the ms settings or disable it. Is it possible to
collaborate on a hack and still protect the innocent?

Do you have a suggestion for a disassembler for the Z-80?

I have used a disassembler on some Motorola 6803 ROMs that accepted a 
symbol file, which defined symbols and associated them with 
addresses. The disaasembler used the symbols as it created the 
source. This was very useful. Even nicer would be the ability to add 
documentation to the symbol file and have it appear in the generated 
listing at the corresponding locations in the code.

I will do some research on this topic, but I'd love hear your 
experiences.

Jim

Thanks for the list. Ida seems interesting. The disassembler that I 
have used in the past is called DASMx. It is downloadable for free on 
the Web. I particularly like 2 of its features - code threading and 
symbol files.

Code threading automatically follows jump and branch instructions to 
find additional streams of code to disassemble. 

The symbol files allow the user to identify code, data, character 
strings, and pointers. The disassembler uses the symbols specified in 
the file whenever the location is referenced in the code. As you 
learn more about the structure of the software, and update the symbol 
file with the new information, successive disassemblies become more 
and more useful.

Jim

Yes, thanks for setting this up!

I have been tinkering with my mailstation for about a year now.
It probably would have just got stuck away in a box, if not for the
motivation provided by hamilton's soldering iron, and rogblake's
disassembler.  (I'm not sure if this is thanks, or blame!!!)

I had studied rogblake's work, and thought I had it figgered out.
But after much frustration trying to get the thing into reflash mode,
I broke out MY soldering iron and hacked in a rom socket.  (If I
post pictures, you will understand why it's called hacking!)  I 
figured if I couldn't get in the back door, I would just build
a new front door.  With a door-man that worked for *me*! 
 
So, I made a few test progs, and determined the address and polarity
of the printer data port bits.  Then I modified a remote debug rom I
had made over 10 years ago, to work with that port.  Now I could
put the beast through it's paces, under the control of my trusty
CP/M system (did I mention it was written over 10 years ago?)

Anyways, my goal is to use the ms for something more interesting
than email.  One idea was to add a barcode reader, and create a
sort of inventory device.  I also like the idea of porting CP/M 
to it.

Would you post what you learned about the printer port, and what you
learned about re-flashing the memories?

Also, do you still have a copy of RogBlake's disassembly? I lost
mine, but I recall that it had some tags on the functions in page 00.

Hi,

Sorry to take so long responding. 

What I know about the printer port, (and most of the 
other ports) is in the thread "ms/z80 hacking" at 
http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowPost&Board=mswhatever&Post=77
There is also info on the banking of the memory, and a 
pinout for the cpu.
Did anybody see this???

As far as the disassembly, I'm not sure how earthlink would feel about
it being posted here.  Some info on addresses in reflash code is on
the other board in the thread "just deals mailstations", as well as 
rogblakes email address, if he is still using it.

I am wondering if it would be better to use that board for
discussion, and this one for files/etc???

And as for reflashing, that involves ethical considerations that I am
unsure of at this point.  I would really like to add functionality,
not cut earthlink out of the picture.

I posted a couple scans of my hardware in the photo section.  
You can rearrange or delete as  you see fit.

Would it be better to post files to the list in the future?

see nothing in the paperwork that says "Thou shalt not hack firmware" 
unless it's using their service unauthorized.

Someone please correct me if they see something I missed.

I do not think earthlink cares one way or another.

The few people here that can hack the hardware, I am sure does not
impact their bottom line.

Now if someone ever figured out how to  externally re-load code, so
any non-tech type can reflash their roms. That would be cutting them out.

I had always thought the posting about $100 to anyone who can reflash
thier MS was posted by someone at earthlink. ( we have a $100 bill for
you, just give us your name and address )

I see two dozen people here, and maybe a few hundred on
linux-hacker.net, thats just not enough to make/break anyone.

The MS devices are not really selling anyway. ( otherwise they would
not be giving them away at OfficeMax)

But, If some does find a way to reflash their MS. 

Please post here :-).

Hello, I want to use the mailstation to type text and then send it to 
a pc directly throug its parallel port. This is my idea: Create a new 
email in the mailstation, then push print button, instead of 
connecting it to a printer, I thougt connecting it to a pc parallel 
port with a program that simulates a printer and acquires the text 
and writes it to a file.

Now here is my question: Does anybody know wich pins of the rs-422 on 
the mailstation have to have a "1" or a "0" to make it believe that 
it is connected to a printer? Because I tried with many combinations 
and the mailstation is still saying that the printer is not 
ready/connected...

Any ideas are welcomed.

What flavor of machine do you have ?

I can make an image of my rom, how would you like it ?

Intel hex, binary, ascii hex ??

What do you intend to do with it ??

Hacking is good, but what are YOU going to do with it ?

I have a MS 150 (v. 4.05a(?)).
I want to discover the hardware specs and completely
rewrite the firmware.  I have found that there appears
to be messages in the 2.xx version which indicate
through-parallel port re-imaging.  If this is true, I
would like to start reprogramming the device from
scratch.  Sure, I like the MS, but it would be fun for
me and my kids to actually start with a clean system.

Format?  .... oops
I would like it in a hex dump that is the form:
   AAAAA0HHHH...HHHss
   A=address
   0=placeholder
   H=data
   ss=checksum
If this is "Intel Hex," cool.
Otherwise, if this is too much of a pain, zip up the

Just to be clear, the copy of the ROM image in the Files section is the Model 100, right?

All the parts listed match the parts in my 100, so I supposed that the ROM does, too.

Yes Jim, Its version 2.53yr.

That dump was created by the hardware in the photo section
under 'ROM DUMP'.

I have not been able to get that hardware working again. So a single
file of my version of ROM will take longer than I thought.

If that 'ROM DUMP' file is good enough, I'll move on to something else.

Don,

That dump seems just fine. I have used a little Pascal program to
convert it into 64 16KB binary files (based on the notes from 
ThePinkPanther) and started disassembling them using DASMx 1.30. 

I need to stop for a while, so I'm in the process of writing up what
I have done so far, in the hopes of encouraging someone else to
continue it for a while. I will upload the binary files that I
created and describe what I have done and learned so far. I hope to
have it done by next week some time.

This venue has been a great inspiration. Thanks again for setting it
up!
Jim

If there is a way a dump of a later version, I would
still be interested in it.  I am concerned that the
system hooks I looking for may be different with the
version (4.03) that my unit has.  If you recall, the
manufacturer has been trying to lock down its built-in
back doors.

This has been the basic problem with the MS device.

The main code ROM is a surface mount chip, soldered down to the board.
As I posted is message 13, people have been trying to figure out how
the MS works internally. 

There seem to be more software people here than hardware people who
are willing to actually hack their hardware. I have one unit that is
no longer functioning. I bought a second unit so I can still play with
one.

If the code in the file section can be hacked so we all can see how
the "uploading code" function works, we can use that to re-load any MS
device. ( but read my comments in message 13 )

There is also a potental problem, that MS engineers changed the way
latter versions reload their code. ( or maybe they removed it
altogether, we have no way of knowing )

On my MS, I removed the code ROM and inserted a surface mount socket.
( but I missplaced the ROM chip in a recent move )
Thats why I bought a second unit.

I have been looking into replacing that code althgether with my own
ROM. Time is my current enemy.

Please review the ROM dump we have now. Maybe you will see something
others have missed, this may help others crack this code.

Hamilton

Opportunity is missed by most people,
Because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.

For anyone who may be interested.

I posted a pic of my MS with surface mount sockets.

The pic shows a ribbon cable (on the left) soldered to the RAM chip.

I connected the other end to a logic analyzer. Tracing with the logic
analyzer, I can see Z80 code executing. ( So I am sure its a Z80 )

But now I have to find the ROM that goes into that socket. :-(

If I can find a serial port on this chip, I will burn a chip with a
debugger. I have used a debugger in the past call NOICE.
http://www.noicedebugger.com/

This can be used to check whats inside the chip. ( along with a logic
analyzer )

I figured out how to get into the setup menu on my Mailstation 350. 


Remove the batteries and use only the ac adapter to power the unit. 

Perform a reset to factory default settings by pressing and holding 
down the keys <Function + D> and power up. Select Yes when asked to 
restore to factory settings. 

During the message "Please wait while system resets" unplug the ac 
adapter.  This corrupts the settings in memory so that the unit will 
now only bring up the setup menu.  

The setup menu asks for User Name, Dial Up Number, Reply to address, 
and E-mail address.  There is also a Network settings button that 
appears in the menu.  Unfortunatly it will not let you put in an e-
mail address or allow you to go to the Network menu.  I'm guessing 
there is some combination of keystrokes or some hidden way to allow 
access to those settings but I haven't been able to figure it out.

That's exactly what I think 99% of the group is looking to change.  getting=
 the newer ones to perform email on any given POP3 system is the prize.  Th=
e older white ones are changeable but the blue non wireless and the 350 wir=

This setup menu looks quite similar to the "mailstation setup"
menu that is accessible under the normal mode main menu item
"setup", then "mailstation".  Except for the erased account
info, that is. 

Neither of the two will let you enter/change the email address.

To get out of the infinite loop of it insisting I fill in 
"all the items", but not letting me enter one of them, I
reset to factory settings again (and let it finish this time).

Does any one have a pinout for the LCD board?

This info is for the LCD in the white mailstation, 
I think it is the same in all models except 300 & 350.

The display is 320 x 128 x 1, but it is really two 160 x 128
displays side by side.  Pins 7 & 10 select which half.

Each half has 20 columns, each column is 8 pix wide, and 128 pix high.

Data is written as if the lcd was a ram.  First the column address is 
written to address #38 while the column reg is selected (pin 8 low).
Then the pixel data for the 128 rows is written, one byte per row, to 
addresses #38 thru #B7 (while pin 8 is held high). 

My guess as to why the rows are numbered #38 thru #B7 is that 
the controller IC inside the LCD can address more than 128
rows, and these were just the most convenient pins to use.

IIRC, the first half is on the left, col 0 is on the right of
each half, row #38 at the top, and d0 at the left of each byte, 
but you might want to check that.

Contrast is controlled with a variable resistor (10k pot with 
wiper shorted to one end) from pin2 to GND.

PINOUT
1	GND
2	contrast
3	+5.2v
4	+5v
5	+5v
6	display enable (or /disable if you prefer)
7	/first half select
8	/column register select
9	/write
10	/second half select
11	A0
12	A1
13	A2
14	A3
15	A4
16	A5
17	A6
18	A7
19	D0
20	D1
21	D2
22	D3
23	D4
24	D5
25	D6
26	D7
27	GND
28	GND

It might not be obvious, but the connector on the main board is a zif.
While it is not difficult to pull the cable out without opening, 
it is rather difficult to get it back in!   :^)  

Just use two thumbnails on the ears at either end to pop it open.

Disclaimer:  I don't have data sheets, I used a meter, and looked at
the code.  Some of this is from memory, and any of it may be wrong.
No animals were harmed in compiling this data.  
(But a few mailstations were.)

There were MANY of these for the Z-80. Search using TRS-80. Many of 
these were written in old versions of MS Basic, but can be ported OK. 
A good place to start is http://www.trs-80.com/

I reassembled the ROM dumps from the files section back to a binary
file and scanned it for strings. I take it from this part that it is
possible to update the flash rom via the parallel printer port! It
also seems that diagnostics may be able to be run that way.

Just have to figure out what code calls 1a08 
 
It's not in the first bank. 
 
dz80, find and grep should prove helpful...

There are flash access subroutines starting around 01f0 in 
Page001.dat 
 
Disassemble it and search for 555 which is the address for the first 
bus write cycle in the command sequence, and you'll see what's 
obviously flash access code.

More details: 
 
Assuming the code in Page 1 dump starts at 8000, 
 
At 81F0 is a subroutine for programming a single byte of flash 
At 82FC is a subroutine for erasing a sector of flash 
 
A jump table starts at the top of 8000. At

Getting closer to that parallel port flash routine. Even if no

The ROM dump hex files encode 32K of binary data each. 
 
Neil's conversion is coming up with 16K binaries, I'm coming up with 
32K (the addresses go to 7FFF. 
 
How big are they supposed to be? 
 
The MBM 29F080A is a 32 64K sectors. Would that mean these flash 
images should actually have 32 64K size files and not 32K (as the 
are) or 16K?

I'm going off the notes on http://www.linux-hacker.net Home / Other
I-Appliances / MailStation / MS/Z80 hacking which describe the bank
setup:-

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 4 slots, of 16k each, at #0000, #4000, #8000, & #C000.
Only slot #4000 & slot #8000 have been observed to be swappable, with
codeflash swapping into #4000, and ram into #8000. Also, it seems
everything except the ram uses #4000 slot. (LCD, dataflash, Modem,
caller ID)

slot #0000 is always codeflash page #00
slot #4000 is codeflash pages #01 to #3f (Or LCD, dataflash, Modem,
caller ID)
slot #8000 is ram pages #1 to #7
slot #C000 is always ram page #00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It seems to me that this is logical but I'm willing to accept
corrections. Don't forget that there is a lot of text material in the
roms along with all the graphics which are used, so any 'code' in
there is irrelevant. I may try to write an 'emulator' which runs
through the roms and maps out the actual code used and the calls
made.

Also, see "U202 - M5M51008-70 ----- 128 kbyte static ram (cpu data)"
which implies that this ram may be bank switched in the C000 space!

Anyone got a service manual for the Mivo 100?

Neil

Well, there is real live code above 4000 in the page 0 hex file. It
disassembles fine and doesn't look like data. In fact, I found some code
there which calls the sector erase function I discovered.

The slots are just chunks of the CPU's address space where blocks of
flash and RAM are mapped in via I/O port accesses. The way the hex files
are broken up is an independent issue. Personally I'd like just to see
the raw 1Meg dump, and then I'd feel better.

I have what's there all disassembled and I can grep for IO. That's how I
found the flash byte write, sector erase and parallel port I/O.

Actually, I just looked at the data sheet again, and it seems they just
have a typo. They say on page 4 that there are 32 64K sectors, but it's
a lie. The picture contradicts, as does the math since then we'd have a
2M chip instead of 1M. Okay, I feel better now...

Service manual type information is probably considered by Cidco as a
trade secret and would likely only be available under NDA, but if it's
out there great. My guess is we're on our own. The port map and memory
map from linux-hacker has been very helpful.

They are selling these units possibly at break-even or slight loss in
order to get follow on email subscribers. So unless we're ready to
partner with them they probably don't have much incentive to give out
the info.

BTW, in my disassembly I am seeing call's to addresses in the 8000 
range, so this information from linux-hacker is not completely 
correct. Sometimes at least, code is mapped into the 8000 slot.

In fact, this may be useful in that it is conceivable that code runs  
from RAM while reprogramming the flash.  
  
The pages I saw making calls to 8000 addresses are:  
  
Page 0x00,  
Page 0x11,  
Page 0x12,  
Page 0x13,  
Page 0x14,  
Page 0x15  
  
I should be able to figure out soon which code page(s) is(are) being  
mapped to 8000. It's probably either 1 or 0 though.

I suspect that the machine may run with 32K of ram in the top half of
memory, the top 16K being fixed, and that the 512K of flash rom is
used as a sort of disk drive, being banked in and out of somewhere.

We have 128K of ram, 512K of flash rom and 1MB of flash rom all being
mapped into 64K.

Could be when you want to swap rom you jump to the ram and call the
routine that swaps rom banks then jump to the rom. You can't really
be 'in' the rom when it switches because of timing. I note there are
routines that jump to 0000 where there are a series of NOP's.
Possibly a delay?

If most all of the calls and jumps are to 0000 - 7FFF then that would
clinch it. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a little software in
ram here and there for special purposes.

The first #0F43 bytes of page #01 are copied to RAM at #8000, 
then jumped to.

This is the reflash code.  Since it has to erase the ROM before
loading the new code, it (reflash) can't run from ROM.  So, while
the code may be ORG'ed #8000, the rom holding that code is 
mapped into the #4000-7FFF slot.

The rest of page #01 is ORG'ed to the #4000 slot.  (At #4F44, 
it is re-ORG'ed to #4F44.)

The code that copies reflash to RAM, then jumps to that copy,
is at #1BC0.

The call to #1BC0 is in page #03 (which just happens to also be
mapped to the #4000-7FFF slot.  IOW, page #03 in slot #4000
makes a call to #1BC0 in page #00, which swaps page #01 into
slot #4000, copies part of it to RAM in slot #8000, then jumps to 
that ram.  One of the first things this code running from RAM
does, is erase the codeflash chip.

The SECTORS that it erases are 64K, or 4 pages each.  
There IS at least one typo in the Fujitsu data sheet.  Under the
heading "FLEXIBLE SECTOR-ERASE ARCHITECTURE", it says
"Thirty two 64 K byte sectors".  There are just sixteen 64 Kbyte 
sectors.  16 x 64k x 8 bits = 8 Megabits, and the 29F080 is
an eight megabit chip.  

You can split the files up any way you find convenient (the rom
is really just a 1 Megabyte block of data).  I think that for 
disassembly, 16k files are best.

There are two pages in each of the 32 hex-dump files, where a
page is defined as the chunks that are bank-switched. 

Also, the RAM is eight pages of 16 kBytes each. 
(8 x 16kBytes = 128 kBytes)

Quite possible. I'll have to look into that. Anyway the calls are to 
the following addresses (these are ones that had more than one 
'call' to them): 
 
8003 
8009 
800c 
8018 
8021 
8024 
8027 
802a 
802d 
8036 
8048 
804e 
805a 
8060 
8124 
8128 
8228 
83c1 
86e4 
 
There are about 50 more but each of them is only ever called once. 
There might be interesting ones in there as well, but these ones are 
more likely to be general utility functions. 
 
Do you get the feeling this group is dead except for what we're 
doing?

But surely you should treat it as 64 * 32K where the lower 16K is the
page000 section in each case?

Which means that for disassembly you need an "ORG 4000h" at the start
and again half way through? I found it easier to deal with in 16K
sections.

Curious, did you just figure this out or did you already know 
this... 
My impression was that no one has gotten this far, but 
maybe I'm looking in the wrong places. 
 
Anyway, that's fantastic. Do you know where the parallel 
port monitor which starts the reflash is at? Also, 
do you know if there is a way through the internet 
connection to reflash? That's my immediate goal, is  
to flash the device non-invasively. 
 
Thanks!

Do you know what the entry point is to the routine in Page 3 that 
calls 1bc0? And who calls it? 
 
And by first 0f43 bytes of Page #1 you mean the beginning of the 
second half (4000 on) of file Page00.hex, correct? 
 
I'm trying to figure out first what sequence of interactions on the 
parallel port and/or keyboard lead to entering the reflash 
procedure. After that is nailed down then I will dive in to the 
reflash itself, assuming no one has already done this.

Couple of questions.

Where does the 512K Flash ROM map into? 4000? 8000? When does this
happen? At shutdown?

Is the printer port fully bi-directional? If so, I assume you could
configure it as a serial port using software.

You are right, you can't switch the bank you are currently executing
code from.  But you can switch the others.  Rom page #00, which is
always located in slot #0000 (#0000-3FFF) has the routines that
handle the bank-switching for slot #4000 (#4000-7FFF), and also
for slot #8000 (#8000-BFFF).

The difficulty with bank switching is that it takes two instructions
minimum to jump to a page that is not already banked in.  One
to select the new page, and another to jump (or call) to it.  If you
try to switch the page you are currently executing from, and you set
the page register with a new page number, the CPU is whisked
away to the new page before it can fetch the jump instuction from
the old page.

The mailstation handles this by making any inter-page calls to
pages #01 thru #3F (in slot #4000) indirectly, going through 
fixed page #00 (in slot #0000).  Code in page #00 handles
saving the old page number for slot #4000, setting the new page 
number, calling the routine in the new page, and on return 
restoring the old page number.

There is a routine at #19AE, with parameters DE=newpage,
and HL=address_in_that_page, that handles this.  There is
also a set of what might be called "page jumps", starting at #003C,
that load DE with a page number, and then jump to #19AE.  You can
think of these as "worm holes" to the higher pages, where HL
holds the address you want to be at on the other side.

Also, starting at #059F there is a really long jump table.
Some of the routines that this table jumps to are in page #00,
and there is just a regular jump to the actual routine.  But
most of the routines are in other pages, so there is a
"LD HL,nnnn" and then a jump through one of page-jump
worm holes.

From the calling routines perspective (slot #4000), a call to this 
jump table is just a call to a routine located in slot #0000, 
even though the actual code will run from slot #4000.

There is also a second bank switch routine, that is almost 
the same as the one at #19AE.  This one is at #1952, and it 
takes it's page & address parameters on the stack.  This one
has an entry in the above mentioned "really long jump table",
at #05ED.  To call an arbitrary page via this method, you
just push the page number and the address on the stack,
after pushing any other params the called routine needs,
and then "CALL #05ED".  I don't know why there are two
ways to do it.

There are other routines in page #00/slot #0000 that access 
the  dataflash, LCD, and modem, by swapping them into
slot #4000, and the ram using slot #8000.

> I note there are
> routines that jump to 0000 where there are a series of NOP's.
> Possibly a delay?

Yeah, that is a bit of a mystery why the code doesn't start
right at #0000.  The z80 "restart's" vector to this space,
could be that they left it open in case they ever wanted to use
them???

My guess is whenever its needed.  But I also wondered if maybe
it is cached in ram to save wear & tear on the flash???

The data lines are, and I think the control bits are too.  Don't know about
the status bits.  I have seen no evidence of the mailstation using
a serial port, but if you meant writing new code to bit bang it,
sure.  For rs232, you might need to clip the voltages to protect
the cpu.

Yes.

I think I see where the confusion comes from.  I hadn't noticed that the hex
files were named "page00.hex" etc.

The mailstation switchable "slots" are 16k each, and the "pages" that
are switched in/out of those slots are 16k each.  Since virtually 
nothing was known about the inards of the mailstation when the
dump was made (almost 3 years ago???) you should not infer any
meaning from the sizes/filenames, except the order that the files
map to the rom.

Once again, each of the hex files contains two of the switchable 
pages.  (just making sure we are all on the same "page".)   :^)
((Sorry!  I couldnt help it!!!))

That would make sense. You have 128K of battery backed banked ram to
work with and so you can consider the 512K flash rom to be a solid
state disk drive. I gather from other linx hacker comments that the
"sector size" for this rom is 2K but perhaps they map in 16K blocks
to work with.

I see strings in the rom like "38400192009600..." which I suspect are
for some display purpose and not just modem strings to process.

AFAIK flash gets neither worn nor torn by reading, just by writing.
Right (yes, I've been wrong before...)?

And even then the real age of a sector I'd think would be how many times
it has been erased (you don't erase a sector every time you write to
it).

I wonder if that custom Z80 has a UART, even if unused? Microcontrollers
often have built in serial ports.

Could be. If we can provide a real or simulated serial port we could
connect the machine to other computers, maybe even to a PDD 1 or 2.

I guess maybe cached was not the right word.  What I meant was
more like a ramdisk, where files would only write through to flash
if the ramdisk was full, or on powerdown.  

That way, when you download, read, then delete a message, it
might never touch the flash.  I'm not saying this is likely, 
just a possibility.

The ram is powered, whenever the powerpak is plugged in, or 
batteries are installed.  And it seems to make a difference to the
mailstation if it is turned off with the power button, or the cord 
pulled.  When shut off properly, it comes back on right to the 
main menu.  But if you pull the power cord while it is on, it says
"scanning memory", and goes to a "reset system data" menu.

The dataflash (28SF040) has 2048 sectors of 256 bytes each.

And it is mapped into slot #4000 1 page of 16k (or 64 sectors) at
a time.  
 
When any particular page of 64 dataflash sectors
is mapped to slot #4000,
The 1st sector is at #4000
The 2nd sector is at #4100
   . . . . . 
The 64rd sector is at #7F00

Try thinking of it from this perspective:  If there is not 
16k of dataflash occupying the #4000-7FFF memory space,
what else is???

You can think of the #4000-7FFF "slot" as a sliding window on a
much larger address space.  The window is 16k high, and it
slides up and down in 16k increments.

You could design a system that slid the window on 256 byte
increments, and then you could put any arbitrary sector at
#4000-40FF.  In that case, you would need 6 more bits of
"page" address.

Maybe you have analyzed the other differences since you posted this 
note, but I have noticed one important one: The code at 1952 executes 
completely in the alternate register set, which means that you can 
use it to pass parameters in the registers.

That is, you could push the page number and program address on the 
stack and setup some registers and call 05ED. The registers will be 
preserved through the code at 1952 and will arrive at the called 
routine intact. Any return values are also preserved. This mechanism 
makes the presence of the page switching logic almost transparent.

John,

Studying the code that runs at 8000, as described in other notes, has 
convinced me that "non-invasive" reflashing is realistic if you 
connect a parallel port to the ms. Since you will most likely need a 
computer to generate the new code, connecting it to the ms via a 
parallel port should be easy. The challenge will be to figure out how 
to get that code at 8000 to run, and the exact structure and timing 
of the parallel port protocol.

There was also talk about reflashing via email messages. I read some 
postings on the linux-hacker web site about the process of requesting 
a new password from the ISP. It was reported that the ISP set the new 
password via an email. The email appeared to contain a validation 
string. When people tried to change the parameters themselves, the 
emails were ignored. It seemed that the validation string was content 
sensitive. I could not find this thread last night, but maybe someone 
else recalls it (hamilton?).

Now changing a password is certainly different than changing code, 
but I suspect both capabilities exist. What a great way to fix bugs! 
Alas, what a way to infect ms's all around the country (world?). For 
that reason, I don't intend to pursue that reflash technique. But I 
am working on the parallel port method.

Jim

Hello Jim --

Finding such a bug in the mailstation that would allow reflashing of the
unit by email would actually be the best way I think, since it is
probably the "normal" path to upgrading the unit.

Also it would detect a security flaw that ought to be fixed. I find it
hard to believe Cidco doesn't have a strategy for mitigating such a
circumstance. That said, even if found I wouldn't recommend publishing
an exploit immediately, but first giving Cidco a chance to respond and
fix the bug. This is how it usually works on the security mailing lists.

My guess is, the normal route of upgrade by email requires the user to
type something at the keyboard (password, whatever). This would preclude
an upgrade being done without permission.

That said, there are probably buffer overflows and other security flaws
hiding in there waiting to be exploited. In any event as long as it is
done "the right way" I don't see any moral or ethical issues in cracking
the mailstation, as long as Cidco gets a chance to respond. Who knows,
the mailstation has been out there a while, the exploit we find may
already be in the wild. Should only the black hats know about it? Better
if it gets fixed. But for me, I'd like to help people upgrade to some
more useful firmware over the net without having to hook up any special
cables (and these days a parallel port cable might be considered
"special" by some, where a phone cord is not special).

Anyway glad to hear you're working on the parallel port hacking. Keep us
apprised. I should be back to hacking that code in a week or two, so you
might beat me to the find.

Later,

-- John.

Read message #69 if you want the context of this reply and John's 
worthwhile points.

John,

Your points ARE worthwhile, and I DO consider myself a "white hat", 
so maybe I'll need to reconsider staying away from the reflashing-via-
the-Internet code. BTW, the reflashing emails were reported to be 
invisible to the end user. According to the reports, they did not 
even show up in the email counts, IIRC.

Sweet Jesus! That's insane that the user didn't have to do anything to
allow them in. But I feel the same as you, that the report is probably
correct. Perhaps they are using encryption, that's the only thing which
could save them in this scenario, and even then they are asking for
trouble.

Well if we could get support to do it again, we could be ready with a
setup like the following:

1. Set up a Linux box as PPP server to connect Mailstation to Internet
through ethernet connection. Run tcpdump or Ethereral on the Ethernet
connection
2. have the mailstation dial into that box
3. Call tech support and get them to upgrade the unit.

Voila, we have a nice packet trace of the transaction for upgrading the
unit.

We just need a unit that requires upgrading, a reason to call and some
gumption as far as the Linux setup, but I think there are already setups
described on linux-hacker for the Linux box.

I wonder if anyone has already done this?

I remember when a flowcharting template was a standard tool for 
programmers, so when I started trying to follow the flow through the 
code that reflashes the code pages, I regressed to using a familiar 
tool. I have uploaded a pdf file called UpdateSoftware-0-1.pdf that 
flowcharts the code at locations 8581 to 86C7 in code page 1. The 
file is in a folder called "Code Analysis" and in a subfolder of that 
called "rom-v253yr".

I gave the code the name UpdateSoftware because seemed to describe it 
well, but I hold no illusions of any rights to name anything. I think 
it might be helpful for someone to start a thread that discusses a 
naming convention for the code that we interpret. 

I continued to flowchart the functions that "UpdateSoftware" calls, 
but I have not finished. Nor have I understood some of those routines 
well enough to name them. I did name the code at 81F0 and 825C after 
the descriptions posted by John in message #43 (and #44).

The "0-1" in the file name is for version 0.1, indicating something 
not really ready for release. I'm sure there are errors in the charts 
because I have already found one. I will post an update that corrects 
it and includes any corrections you notice. 

The flowcharts are intended the show the algorithms expressed in the 
code, so sometimes 10 or 20 bytes of loading, pushing, popping, and 
adding are reduced to a decision block with "Yes" or "No" paths out 
of it.

I will try to finish this, but I covet your inputs,
Jim

Man, you are a master of documentation and reverse engineering. We covet
your outputs :-)

I scanned through it, I'll look closer later. I didn't see how
UpdateSoftware gets triggered. Perhaps you haven't found that yet?

Also, what program did you create this pdf file with? Can you upload the
source so we can edit it as the group discovers more names for routines
or should we just email them to you?

Thanks!

"Get that code at 8000 to run" .. perhaps when the reflash tool is connected
and you select the setup mode on the MS it recognizes the device and enables
the operation from the keyboard?

BTW, I have seen messages which imply that some limited reprogramming can be
done via the phone line.

It gets called by the code that Cyrano found at 1BC0 (see messages 
#52 and #60). The code at 1BC0 jumps to location 8000 which contains 
a jump to "UpdateSoftware".

Do you know the saying, "Everything looks like a nail to a guy with a 
hammer?" Well, my "hammer" is Adobe FrameMaker. I have used it for 
almost 10 years, hated it for the first one or two, and now use it 
for all but the most trivial of documents, for which I use Word, 
Wordpad, or Notepad. Anyway, I would be happy to upload the 
FrameMaker document if anyone can use it. In the meantime, I'd be 
willing to maintain UpdateSoftware and the other routines at 8000 
based on y'alls input.

Frame... well I guess you'll be maintaining that document ;-)

I have a copy for Winders somewhere, but I doubt anyone else does. We
can just send you updates to make.

Later,

Took a few steps back from 1bc0... we're getting closer I think...

It looks like this is the last real branch point to decide if code at
8581 will be called.
But it is a test for good +6V. Could be trigger, but maybe just checking
if system is in top shape before trying to burn new firmware?

Anyway if someone has time they should take another step back to see how
we get to 85b6.

Almost there!


Hope this is not too convoluted:

It is in the page00 hex dump file.

; (there is a vector to here at 0A74)
1b92  db09      in      a,(#09)         ; read printer control/power

1b96  2006      jr      nz,#1b9e        ; jump to non-zero return

1b9d  c9        ret                     ; return zero.

If this returns non-zero, then the firmware update process will begin,
as you can see here:

Actually, I just realized what the +6V check is for: it is probably just
verifying that it is currently powered from the wall cube and not the
battery. This would make sense, since it reduces that chance of
interruption during programming due to battery dying in the middle of
the burn, and leaving the unit permanently hosed.

Well it's good to know anyhow. The unit won't permit firmware to be
updated via parallel port unless powered from the wall.

Makes sense. Have you found the test to see if the programmer is attached?

No I haven't found the "trigger" yet. I had a few minutes last night so
I made the notes I mentioned in prior mail. My guess is it will turn out
to be holding some key combination. That or a jumper somewhere. Or maybe
there is a window during power up that it listens to the port. Who
knows. I would think though they would want it to be fairly "hands free"
but anything is possible.

I was just looking again, and I'm actually not certain what the 6V are
for. If they wanted to check for wall cube I guess they would have
checked for 9.5V. So there's still room for speculation here.

There's a test in there for FN+Shift+T or FN+Shift+Size during power up
which sets the machine into diagnostic mode. I suspect it's allied with
that.

Okay, I'm out of time on this for the moment, but there's good eatin'
around here somewhere...

More parallel I/O!

842d, 8459, and 848f, which actually run at 442d, 4459, 448f.

Trigger should be near by. Who has time to pull it?

This thread on linux-hacker contains a capture of one of the clipmail

extensions that cause problems with some pop servers.  I seem to
remember that someone else did experiments that showed the
problem was that some pop servers choked on the extra mime-types
that the mailstation recognizes (such as "Content-Type: x-clipmail/text").

There are strings in the code regarding downloading applications,
but I don't know if cidco ever offered any extra apps.  If you can
figure out how to download any executable code, then you
can pretty much bootstap your way up from there.

There is some sort of security key, that would surely need to be
"understood" before you could use this route.

Someone in this thread on linux-hacked mentioned they believe the unit
may accept reflash right after reset.

Anyone have a logic analyzer? If we could try throwing some characters
to the unit on the parallel port right after reset and see what
addresses appear on the address bus, this might take us to the parallel
port reflash trigger detection code.

A question for the hardware hackers: should any parallel cable work? And
do we think any PC with bi directional parallel port could drive it?

The test for reflash is at #03:451c, and it seems to be 
called continuously while the mailstation is running.

It uses a parallel laplink style interface.  I don't know if 
a parallel port can drive a "straight" cable and talk to it. 

Laplink uses 5 data lines (d0-d5) to "talk", and the 
5 status lines to "listen" (crossed, data on one end to
the status on the other).

I have some pascal code that matches the mailstation send/receive
routines.  I'll try to post more soon, but i gotta go to sleep now...

There are almost as many different pinouts for this cable
as there are websites with a pinout.  But all of them
have in common the pins that are actually used by the 
mailstation (pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 13, 12, 10, 11, and 
at least one of the eight ground pins) 

You need to cross the low 5 data pins at "one" end, to
the status pins at the other.
              D0  2  to  15
              D1  3  to  13 
              D2  4  to  12
              D3  5  to  10
              D4  6  to  11

And cross the 5 status lines at end "one" to the
low 5 data pins at the other. 
          /ACK 10  to  5
         BUSY 11  to  6 
PAPEROUT 12  to  4
            SEL 13  to  3
        /FAULT15  to  2

And at least one ground.
            GND 25 to 25 

> What is this extra wire you mentioned.

I used a Belkin F3D508-10.  IIRC, it did not
have any extra conductors, and I wanted to
be able to reset the mailstation from the PC.
So I added the logic to the mailstation
to reset whenever the PC asserted both
busy and strobe at the same time.  

NOTE!!!!! the "busy" and "strobe" signals refered
to in my code are NOT THE SAME as the
busy and strobe lines on your standard parallel port.
The signal names in the table above ARE the names
from the standard parallel port, just for reference.

I may make up a better diagram sometime.
Also, I noticed that the web inteface to the list
mangled the pascal code (removed indents).
I uploaded a zip of the same file to the file section.

It seemed from that thread there was some kind of encryption key.

Not that it can't be cracked... The question is if anyone the the skill
to do so wishes to look at it (I am no crypto expert).

If experience holds, they probably are only doing an encoding, and not
real encryption, but they could be.

Has anyone looked around for the email maintenance routines?

Below are some of my notes on the update routines.  UpdateSoftware
sounds like a good name to me.  I didn't name all of the functions,
some are just descriptions of what the function does.  I am open
to suggestions for better or more "correct" names for any of them, 
but I am kinda partial to "send_tribble" and "recv_tribble".  ;^)

81F0 actually writes a whole "logical" sector of bytes (256 bytes).
And it seems that the only time the actual hardware sector
size is used, is during erase.  So I would propose that the
word "sector" means 256 bytes, and use "hardware_sector"
when refering to the physical sector.  Or maybe "physical_sector"
is better, hell I dunno.

I'm sure there are errors in my info below, too.  I always seem
to notice one right after I press "send".  I'm not sure just
how many hours it took to type/edit it, but it was too many.
It's funny how notes that are good enough for personal use
seem to need so much editing before publishing.  I  probably
could keep polishing them forever.  But I am determined to post
this tonight, so I will stop, and instead rely on a disclamer:
 "This info might be all wrong.  Turn back now.  
  You have been warned."   :-)

;; I guess that after erasing codeflash, it won't quibble over the power source, and you can load new code on batteries. ;^)
;; If download is ok, it sets the flag in dataflash to "codeflash valid", and then sets a flag in ram, which I am

I just got a 120 and a 150. FWIW I suspect the differences are more software
than hardware. One thing the manual says is that when you dial in via the
800 number it will figure out where you are and will usually substitute a
local number. This means that some updating can be done via the phone line,
even if only the phone number.

Wow! Thanks, I'll get to work on updating the flowcharts. I picked up 
a copy of TurboCAD 8.0 at a used book store for about $20. I'm 
considering converting the flowcharts and putting out the TurboCAD 
files in addition to the PDF. Would that be useful?

You're welcome.

TurboCAD 1.0 was one of the first (and few) programs I ever bought.
I didn't even have a computer that could run it 'till a year or two
later.  I never really used it for much, but it sure was neat watchin'
it draw the "oilrig" demo!!!

If it can render the drawing in a gif or bmp format, it might work
better than pdf for others to edit or add to.  Otherwise, pdf is
probably easiest to view for most.

My tool of choice when I need to see a flowchart has been
the "manual graphite display generator".  :-)

Free tools you might consider are dia, xfig, sodipodi, ooimpress
(ooimpress is like powerpoint, can read some powerpoint files, it's part
of openoffice.org)

These are all available for Linux, maybe Cygwin. But if I have anything
to add I can just send you comments if you would rather. Just as long as
you produce PDF or GIF or something readable via Free tools.

I would agree, the 120 and 150 are nearly identical, and
probably not even much difference in the software. 

I have a 120, and on the back of the case it says
"mivo 200".  Does anybody here remember when the models
were 100, 200, 300?  And what the difference was between 100, and 200?
I've nerer even seen a 200 listed on ebay, did they ever release one?
I bet the 120 is a reflashed 200.  My 120 has 3 layers of serial
number stickers.

I also have a strong hunch that the "white mailstations"  (mivo 100/mailstation 100)
are really leftover e-message units, reflashed to version 3.03a.

The emessage's, that AFAIK were marketed thru phone companies,
functioned as a  caller id device, and the 100's have the caller id
chip, but no caller id function.

I have a white emessage unit, with v2.21 software.  The lowest
version I have seen in a brown unit is 2.22.

Also, my white mailstation 100 has a second serial#
sticker over the original.  

I noticed that most of the serial numbers I had started with 99.
But then I noticed one that started with 00, and it was newer.
And my 150 starts with 01,  And then I noticed the only
white one I had started with 02.  At first it seemed odd
that the oldest had the highest serial numbers, then I
realized it was probably a date code.  If it works like
the date codes on IC chips (4 digits), then the first 4 digits
of the serial number is YYWW (2 digit year, 2 digit week,
where last week in Dec. is 52)

Real interesting, I know, but I peeled the sticker off of
my 100, and the one on the bottom had date code in 99!

So thats why I think the white ones are really the oldest
models, just with a "newer" version of the software.  And
as far as I can tell, the main differences are:  This new
version has no caller id, even though the caller id chip is
still inside;  The fax send has been removed;  They are
now limited to a single user.

The clipmail commands (that are embedded in certain special 
email messages) come in over the phone line.

IANAL, but IMHO It doesn't matter.

>From my perspective, this is a perfectly legitimate effort to reverse
engineer the code in order to use a device I bought.

I never agreed to anything with any company Earthlink, Cidco, or
otherwise. I haven't even connected the thing to an ISP, so there is no
chance that I ever Clicked through a license agreement of any kind.

I bought the unit, I can do anything I want with it. I can erase the
flash, I can replace it with something else. I can take a sledgehammer
to it, etc. It's property, I own it. That said, I can't make copies of
the software within for redistribution to people who don't own a
mailstation due to copyright law. And if we find some encryption
anywhere that is intended to prevent copying of the software we aren't
allowed to break it (see: DMCA). But we haven't seen anything like that,
AFAIK. In any event for the purposes here I can't see how that would be
a proper application of DMCA, but I am not a lawyer.

Certainly the end product of a reflash app could never be an
infringement of copyright since we don't have access to the source code
of the original reflash application. And as above, I'm not breaking any
license agreement or contract since I never made any agreement.

So once we get to an actual reflash app I think there is even less to
worry about, since it will all be original code. I'd be more worried
about posting the original binary images than the reflash app, since
someone who doesn't own a CIDCO Det1 might download it, and that would
be an illegal distribution (copyright infringement) under copyright law.

As everyone here knows the $100 reward is a joke any way you look at it,
at least if you're using the brute force approach which is what it seems
we're left with. I wonder how much that $100/hour would divide out to
with the man-hours spent so far on this effort?

Hopefully we're all having fun with this, since that's all this is
really about...

I was sort of jokeing as well. But, with DMCA running around it 
seemed to be a case of baiting. I think I said ( maybe I thought 
it ) earthlink or who ever has control now is not interested in a 
few hackers. But if any novice with a MS can cut out the 
subscription cost and link to a free email server, then someone 
(i.e. earthlink) may get heart burn over that.

I have been reviewing and incorporating your notes, but I have some

Unless you are nitpicking his code (which I doubt) the list is a
perfectly good forum for this kind of thing.

Hi,

I can't think of any reason to not use the list, other than
not making it too easy for any nitwit to reflash his mailstation.
I'm certainly not worried about annoying the 99% who just
want free email!

My email is this id, at yahoo.com if you want to use that.

Use your judgement, I don't mind using the list.  It's probably
the fastest way for me, since I go for days without reading
any of my email boxes.  For that matter, a note to the list
to check my mailbox wouldn't hurt (me) if you want me to see
it sooner!  I check the web archive of this list more often
than email, usually.

I have been thinking (but not really doing anything) about
what to flash into my mailstation.  The reflash code erases
most of the mailstation code, and I wanted to figure out how
to back up the existing code first, if possible, so it can
be patched.  I know that if I want v2.53yr, that is moot.
But I still thought it would be good to be able to reflash
without needing to download the code.

Hopefully whatever you flash will allow reflashing again,
and one of the first things I think needs to be fixed is
the all or nothing nature of the existing reflash code.
If you are willing to wipe out the mailstation code, you need
to replace it with something.  Maybe a rom monitor, or the 
remote code for a remote debugger, or else a whole new app.

Or maybe a new OS?  Has anybody here ever heard of UZI???
It is a unix for z80, written many years ago, by Doug Braun.
I don't know if/how he handled the lack of a protected mode.
http://www.dougbraun.com/uzi.html

There is a newer version, called uzix, for the MSX computer.
MSX is a z80 system that was popular (I hear) outside of the US.

I have some ideas on what to put there.

For development purposes, a remote target monitor/debugger like NoICE
would be ideal.

Eventually, what should go there?

Porting CP/M to the mailstation would open up the gigantic library of
CP/M software to the mailstation. My NEC 8500 and NEC Starlet ROMs might
be a starting point, or perhaps just going from CP/M source code which
is available on the web. There's an active CP/M mailing list of folks
who would give profuse thanks for the ready availability of a new CP/M
laptop. The unused portion of flash becomes a flash disk for CP/M to use
as a drive or drives. There are plenty of CP/M compilers (Pascal, C)
which could then be self-hosted on mailstation. There's also Wordstar,
and other popular programs available that could be run without even
porting them (generally CP/M programs do all console I/O to a terminal
emulation).

Some folks on the Model 100 mailing list, including myself are
interested in the Mailstation as an upgrade path from Model 100, so
another track is to get the Model 100 BASIC ROM running on Mailstation.
The Model 100 uses 8085, which is almost identical to 8080 in
instruction set, so it should work on Mailstation. There is also the
WP-2, which is a word-processor feel-alike to the Model 100. It uses
Z-80, and might make an interesting port to Mailstation.

Another idea is an ANS Forth environment like CamelForth loading on the
Mailstation. This would allow programming on the mailstation itself, and
porting Forth to any system is as easy as it gets.

Unix for Mailstation... I suppose that could work. Would open up
possibility of compiling some open source software for mailstation. My
only argument with that is that a most of that stuff is written for more
powerful machines. If you went with CP/M or BASIC or Forth, which were
tailored to 8 and 16-bit systems from the get-go, we'll get much better
performance. The disadvantage is less new software.

I do try to echo progress on Mailstation on my bitchin100.com web site.
Folks here might want to check it out to see what my angle is...

-- John.

Oh another thing you might consider running eventually is the Z80 port
of Contiki.

This has an email client, web browser, VNC server, web server, TCP/IP,
CSLIP for 8-bit machines.

If we added PLIP, it would be ideal for Mailstation since it only has a
parallel port. And we all now have laplink cables I'm sure...

I have been working on a version of my remote debugger for
flashing into an unmodified mailstation.  I will post it when
it is ready.  (I had hoped to have it before now, but there 
have been many distractions...)

I am interested in this, too.  The CP/M BIOS should be all you
need to port.  That, and you would need to write/find a terminal 
emulator.

CP/M likes to have ram in low memory area, so you might 
need to make a small mod to the mailstation hardware,
since the mailstation normally has fixed rom in slot #0000.

I have written CP/M BIOS code for console keyboard matrix 
scanning (for Megatel Quark hardware), and a ramdisk driver
(for custom 512k bankswitched ram mod on Quark).  A driver
for a flashdisk shouldn't be *too* much trouble.  :-)

Hmmm...  I wonder if your ReMem would fit inside the mailstation?  :-)

I looked at Contiki.  
http://www.sics.se/~adam/contiki/
They mention z80 ports, but I can't find any (working) links to
any.  (They say there is a gameboy port, and gameboy is z80 based.)

It seems that Contiki will only run apps that are written as
"Contiki apps" (state machine style multitasking).  But the 
Contiki Tool-Kit  might be the easiest way to get a GUI on 
the mailstation.

Sounds like you're the expert... and therefore the stuck-ee ;-) I'm just
learning about CP/M

I've written some flash code here and there. I could definitely handle
that. I need to write one for ReMem anyway which could be used in both
places.

Alas, running the 100 ROM is a cool trick but I wouldn't recommend mass
producing it ;-) or leaving a ready binary for download. I think it
would be sufficient for the developers to each have a genuine
non-operational Model 100 motherboard.

The software to be produced would be a "patch" against a real Model 100
ROM. The end user could apply it themselves. They would be responsible
for never using their mailstation and their Model 100 at the same
time...


> Hmmm...  I wonder if your ReMem would fit inside the mailstation?  :-)

If we want to make a mod to the mailstation it is possible. However, the
mailstation is already a pretty capable machine, especially once we turn
it into a general purpose laptop (insofar as a model 100 is considered a
laptop). Probably should at a serial port, possibly make it a USB slave
emulating RS232 behavior over USB... power would come from the host.
Maybe IR to talk to wirelessly to cell phones and printers. The parallel
port is fine for I/O to PC's though.

In fact I am interested in a case mod to the Tandy M102 that would put a
mailstation into a 102 case. So the question beomes would a mailstation
with whatever additional hardware needed fit into a 102 case. Plenty of
room there, and a much better keyboard.

There are at least two, the PC-6001 and the Z-80. I don't know if the
Apple ran some type of CP/M? Or the Commodore 128?

Well state machine driven stuff is not hard to design. In fact just
about all my programs of any complexity end up having a state machine. 

What else do we need besides the default Contiki apps? Some kind of
interpreter, Forth or BASIC. Forth is easy to port. And a text editor.

With the Yahoo option, just set it up.

Otherwise:-

FN+Shift+T or FN+Shift+Size are for MailStation 100

===================================================
If you press Function + d (on the MS 150, V4.04D) and press the
hard reset button (with a paper clip) you'll get a slightly different
menu dialog (the "Reset System Data" menu) after the memory scan? You
have to keep holding Function + d after the reboot to see it.
The menu shows an additional item: "Restore Default Account".

===================================================
I figured out how to get into the setup menu on my Mailstation 350.

Remove the batteries and use only the ac adapter to power the unit.

Perform a reset to factory default settings by pressing and holding
down the keys <Function + D> and power up. Select Yes when asked to
restore to factory settings.

During the message "Please wait while system resets" unplug the ac
adapter. This corrupts the settings in memory so that the unit will
now only bring up the setup menu.

The setup menu asks for User Name, Dial Up Number, Reply to address,
and E-mail address. There is also a Network settings button that
appears in the menu. Unfortunatly it will not let you put in an e-
mail address or allow you to go to the Network menu. I'm guessing
there is some combination of keystrokes or some hidden way to allow
access to those settings but I haven't been able to figure it out.

===================================================
Good work Jeff. I could perform the reset with batteries as well.
All I did was to to use a pin inserted on the little hole on the
back to press the reset button during the message "Please wait
while system resets". Then, press Fnct-D keys during the next
power on.


===================================================
A Mivo 250 uses Fcn-Shift-SIZE!!! Not T!!!

===================================================
Great news! I was able to configure a Mailstation (black) original model to

I just aquired a mailstation with the following markings:

Body color: black
Markings: CIDCO MODEL DET1
Function-Shift-T-(Power ON) brings up Diagnostic Main Menu
Version: 2.55Y

After I quit the diagnostic menu I get a "Reset System Data" menu.
After I reset all of the systems data I can create a new user.
All fields are blank including the POP3/SMTP lines.

My questions are:
Can I use this to call into my home linux server and get my mail that 
way. Also, has anyone created a small linux to run on the mailstation 
and become a small terminal, etc...?

All of this is covered on linux-hacker.net .

Yes. See linux-hacker.net in the mailstation section

No. The effort on this list is to reverse engineer the device and flash
a new image to it such that some other OS could eventually be run.

Linux will not run on a Z80. No MMU, virtual memory, etc. uCLinux,
maybe. A better OS for this device is CP/M, which makes a perfectly good
terminal, word processor, and can run various compilers (an example of a
nice CP/M laptop is the Amstrad NC100 or NC200 running ZCN). We're
talking an 8-bit CPU here. The best thing to do is either have no OS, or
an OS that was optimized for 8-bit devices and their constraints.

I just got one of the Yahoo mailstations. This one apparently used the Yahoo
functions because a couple of the special Yahoo messages were left on it.
The weather one has a graphic indication of the weather. The other is a
listing of TV shows for the networks.

I'm calling on your collective vast experience.  I got a Cidco DET1-01
Mailstation, with the yahoo thingy on screen.  I set it up to dial via
my local ISP and use yahoo as the POP and SMTP server.

It dials up OK, connects to the ISP modem, but keeps giving " the
server is currently unavailable or busy ? please try again later? ."
when sending and receiving mail.

Has any one else got this model to work with yahoo?  I see no reason
why it should not work and suspect it's just a silly mistake I may
have overlooked.

Do you have the Yahoo POP service? You have to pay for it, it isn't free.
Otherwise you'll need to find a free or pay dial up POP mail ISP. You can't
use HotPop either since it isn't dial up.

Yeh, I can access yahoo pop service via my mail client so that means
it all works fine.  I know yahoo requires an auth login and I don't
know if the Mailstation does any smtp authorization or not.  If not
then that obviusly the problem.

I've set mine up to access my ISP's POP mail OK and that uses all the
current stuff. It is do-able.

Hi, everybody,

I'am one of the authors of the UZIX (but, guys, it was so long 
ago...). I own the MIVO-100 and I only wanted to completely replace 
the software and reuse device as some kind of controlling one for my 
hobby needs. It looks like this device is very similar internally 
(meaning CPU and page banking) to MSX we targetted the UZIX to. I'm 
very impressed by all reverse engineering you (and linux-hackers 
guys) did! My question is - is there some clean descriptions of the 
box internals or one should go thru forums gathering the info and 
erratas?

So - if anybody will be interested, I could contact with the Adriano 
(current maintainer of the UZIX) looking for possible porting it onto 
Mailstation (as soon as it's Z80 CPU).

I think it would be great to have a unix like OS for mailstation. The
other possibility is CP/M or a complete Forth environment. 

Try this link to I/O map on Linux Hacker, it has proven correct so far.

Hey man don't clutter up the list with OT stuff!

Just kidding. It's a welcome change the only other thing from this list
in months is a spam mail.

One of these days I'll get back to the mailstation. Cyrano Jones, if
you're out there, are you happily loading firmware over the parallel
port yet?

I made a version of my remote debugger, and flashed it
into an unmodified mailstation.  Breakpoints do not work (yet)
with this version.  I have been hammering on the PC half of
the software, trying to get it into a presentable form.

The reflashing protocol that I posted a while ago seems to
work!  As far as any "new" code, all I have done is poke a
short routine into ram via debugger (hex edit), and 
execute it.  It reads a key from keyboard, stores the
scan code in ram, and turns on the mail LED.  :-)

I have not found any way (yet) to save the existing code
to disk before reflashing.  That means that you have to
wipe out most of the mailstation code when you flash
the remote debug code.  You even have to wipe out the
font data, so I haven't done any output to LCD yet.  
No "Hello world" yet.   :-(

It is probably gonna be "easy" to use the LCD code from
the reflash routines, I just have not got 'round to it yet.
I have not been able to play with this project as much as I 
would like to lately.

If I post pascal code (compiles with Freepascal), is anyone
here gonna be able to use it?  Or should I post binary???
And does anyone know where the summer went????

Is it possible to load/flash a dump routine into 'ram' and use that to
download the code?

What target debugger are you using?

So you're saying you haven't found any "read block" command? That's a
bummer. Certainly manageable given we're replacing it anyway and someone
already has provided an image, but it would be nice to be able to get an
backup of any given mailstation.

My Pascal knowledge is rusty but certainly workable. If you want to put
the code under open source license I could get us a SourceForge project
set up.

I thought everyone had given up on this.  I see it's not the case.

Has anyone been able to change the server settings from Earthlink?  I've
still got 2 brand new units here.  I was going to take one and toy around
with the idea of spoofing their IP inside my own DNS and creating my own
dialup port.  With WiFi being "everywhere" around Atlanta it's not really
worth the trouble anymore though.

I had tried back when these were "free" to get a womens shelter to get them.
They said they were only accepting PII or better machines for donation and
they "preferred laptops".  Well La De Dah!  I never thought I'd see the day
you could not give away a free machine!

Good luck, good hacking!

I am interested in running alternative firmware on the thing... say with
ZCN or maybe a hacked up TRS-80 Model 100 ROM, or a make it a
stand-alone Forth machine...

In fact interfacing to the outside world is a challenge on the
mailstation. It's highest speed interface is its parallel port.

Once we have alternative firmware, I think a MailStation will be every
bit as useful as the various smart keyboards that are around. Only thing
that would make it much better is if it had a USB port.

CJ has already done the heavy lifting by reverse engineering the code
enough to produce a tool which can program the flash over the parallel
port.

Unforunately I don't know much about using the existing firmware. There
are various notes over at linux-hacker which you've probably already
found.

If you use the native reflash function, it will erase the
old code before you can flash any new "download" code into
the code rom.

I don't know how to get any code into ram, let alone how 
to make the mailstation execute it if you did.

There is the possibility of loading code into the dataflash,
but so far the only way I can think of to get it to execute
it would require minor surgery on the pc board.

The existence of the 2.53yr rom dump makes dumping the code
an academic exercise, for the brown mailstations at least.

The ergonomic case models have a different keyboard layout,
so I would guess that you would not want to flash the 2.53yr 
code into one of those (assuming that the key matrix is 
different, too).

Until someone rewrites all the functionality that is in the
original rom (keyboard scanning, LCD display, flash filesystems,
modem driver, etc., etc.), reusing the original code seems
like a real good idea.  

I had hoped that it would be possible to reuse that code, 
WITHOUT the need to download it from some BBS somewhere.  
But I have noticed that the word "copyright" does not seem 
to be found anywhere in the code, so perhaps it is not as 
important as I thought???

One of the things on my "To Do List" is to make a version
of the debug code that can be overlaid on the 2.53yr dump, 
and then reflashed, but it would probably only work on the
brown (version 2.somethin) models.

I do plan to put it up here, under some sort of open licence.
I think I would prefer to post it as source, so I don't have
to worry about virus issues.  And maybe someone will want to 
port it to another language?  I'm not big on c, but I have
thought about re-doing it in perl myself.

The reason it is in Pascal is that it grew out of a program
I wrote a long time ago, to poke around inside of the arcade 
Pacman code.  It seemed easier at the time (when I started
messing with the mailstation) to just extend the old code.

I've done a little research in the patent office, and found something 
interesting about the Mailstation...

The Mailstation "Desktop Email Terminal" is covered under U.S. Patent 
number 6,697,942. I've read the patent, and it seems to me that the 
best way to reflash the device lies in breaking the ClipMail security 
key it uses to verify the messages.

Once the machine sees a valid key, it will update the flash using an 
attached file.  If the security key verification process could be 
reverse-engineered, maybe valid keys could be generated.

The patent mentions DES, but it may be encrypted using some other 
algorithm. I have no expertise in encryption/decryption, so I have no 
idea of how to go about breaking it. Maybe it's worth pursuing, 
though.

As a programmer the typical policy is not do any patent searches.

a) I don't know much about patents anyway -- which ones will hold up in
court and which won't? Just about all tech patents are granted after
enough changes. It doesn't mean that the patent isn't invalid for
various reasons (prior art, etc.)
b) I can't afford to pay a real lawyer to do a search for every idea I
think of implementing
c) If I was sued for infringement and the plaintiff won, and I knowingly
infringed the patent, I would be liable for triple damages.

As far as legal issues here, you are more likely to run afoul of the
DMCA for trafficking in an illegal circumvention device for producing
code that breaks the encryption.

So if you are planning on going that route, you are clearly into
violation of law which is a whole other matter than patent infringement.


On copyright issues, which CJ brought up: whether a (C) notice appears
in firmware doesn't really matter. I'd warrant most binary software does
not embed a (C) string anywhere.

According to the Berne Convention, as soon as a work is fixed in a
tangible medium it is automatically protected by copyright. The only
thing that gives you a right to make copies/ redistribute it is a
license. None of us have such a license.

Your points about the DMCA, patents, and copyrights are well taken. I 
hadn't even thought about the DMCA.

The security key I mentioned in my earlier message might prevent any 
change to the machine no matter how it's introduced. I hope it 
doesn't affect the parallel port, because that seems to be the only 
viable method for changing the flash without using cryptography. I'm 
afraid, though, that any software modification could potentially 
violate the law.

I hope I'm not heading toward a legal brick wall by trying to add 
functionality to the Mailstation. It would be a shame to let such a 
portable machine languish on just email.

There is lots of software around that is in violation of the DMCA but is
still widely used, such as DeCSS used by Linux users to view DVDs.

The trick is the original code was developed by someone Jon Johansson in
the Netherlands, and you generally have to download the code from non-us
servers.

I believe there is a DMCA exemption for legitimate security research, if
that helps you.

In any event, there is no encryption key issue on the unit CJ has been
working with via the parallel port.

The encryption is there (quite rightly) to protect your mailstation from
being attacked from the Internet. It is not intended to prevent
reflashing the unit. Anyway, CJ has already succeeded in altering his
firmware via the parallel link so we have a proof-of-concept right
there.

The DMCA doesn't tell you what you can do with your own hardware. It
covers trafficking in circumvention devices. So if you author and
distribute a circumvention device then you are in violation of the DMCA.
If you created it but didn't distribute it, or you gave your unit to
someone else and they unlocked it for you, for example would not be a
DMCA problem.

Of course, IANAL, so take all this with a grain of salt.

I personally hate the DMCA, software and business method patents,
virtually perpetual copyrights, and the abandonware problems our
copyright system creates. They are severe and intolerable limits on
Freedom.

Unfortunately freedom in the software and media realm isn't taken to be
an important issue by the average citizen, so the law is going to stay
screwed up for a long time, I think.

I've looked at the possibility of breaking the key code, but this could be dangerous in light of the DMCA.
 
The method of sending updates to a Mailstation is covered by US Patent 6,697,942.  The "security key" is discussed in this patent, and the patent mentions "Simple DES" cyphers.  I'm no expert in cryptography, so I wouldn't know how to go about generating a valid key, and even if I did, there's no guarantee that the method described in the patent is the method used.
 
Any attempt to circumvent the security process could result in legal issues. This is why I haven't looked into this area very closely. I've created and sent messages to my Mailstation without a security key and have had no luck in updating anything. It seems that the security key verifies that the message is legit, and without it you're going to have no luck in changing any settings.
 
Another member is exploring the possibility of changing the contents of the on-board flash through the parallel port built in to the machine. I think there's more possibility of success using that approach, but it requires extra equipment that I don't have right now.
 
The processor is a Z80-derivative, so information is readily available on the Web. The problem is that there could be several megabytes of code to wade through to find the code that verifies the key, and it may not be easy to recognize when you see it. I'm not saying it's impossible; it's just not your typical weekend project. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before someone isolates that code and finds a way around it.

The default account is the
@.... this is handy if you
are giving a mailstation away and don�t want to leave
any information (e-mails, settings, or address book
information) in the unit.

I know the "Function + Shift + T + Power On" should
work for putting your own settings in. When you use
"Function + Shift + T + Power On" that should leave
you at the �Diagnostic Menu�. First you need to do the
�Fast Test�, this should be option number 2. This will
test �Flash, Key, Printer Port, RAM and ROM�, after
that screen it will go to the �Battery TESTING�
screen. You then need to hit the �Enter� key twice,
this will drop you back to the �Diagnostic� Menu, now
hit �Q� for quit. You should see the �Test Over!�
message, then it will dump you out at the standard
reset menu, just hit �No Clear� and if all went well
you should see a prompt like �Please create a new user
account�. Just hit OK and slap you info in to the
unit.

Also I was able to find some interesting information
on the XTND commands. The XTND commands are used in
configuration of the mailstation. When a configuration
is generated the key code is also created verifying
that it�s a real configuration. The unit will then
take all the configuration information and configure
its-self.

From what i have gathered there are 2 parts to the
mailstation service. First you have your standard POP3
Mailbox and they have a Mail Proxy that sits over it.
The Mail Proxy chops up long e-mails and strips out
some advertisements that would normally cause the mail
not to come though. I don�t know what method the proxy
uses to figure what parts to strip but if anyone has
idea please let me know.

|-------| |-----| |-------|
|POP3 |<->|PROXY|<--|MAIL |
|Mailbox| | | |STATION|
|-------| |-----| |-------|

Anyways this leaves me with several questions about
the key code. I�m thinking that the Mail Proxy
verifies the key and sends all the configuration
information to the mailstation. I have tried to
simulate configuration messages but to no avail.
Anyone else working in this direction?

aahhh I see. Well, I can understand wanting to stay
out of legal/DMCA issues. Well I guess we will have to
look at something else. I for one dont want to get in
trouble over a mailstation. Well I'm going to do some
more thinking, and see what I can figure out. I'll
keep you posted.

It seems the parallel flash is going to be the best
bet to do anything with the mailstation :)

Oh well, just a though....

---------------------------------------

I've looked at the possibility of breaking the key
code, but this could be dangerous in light of the
DMCA.
 
The method of sending updates to a Mailstation is
covered by US Patent 6,697,942.  The "security key" is
discussed in this patent, and the patent mentions
"Simple DES" cyphers.  I'm no expert in cryptography,
so I wouldn't know how to go about generating a valid
key, and even if I did, there's no guarantee that the
method described in the patent is the method used.
 
Any attempt to circumvent the security process could
result in legal issues. This is why I haven't looked
into this area very closely. I've created and sent
messages to my Mailstation without a security key and
have had no luck in updating anything. It seems that
the security key verifies that the message is legit,
and without it you're going to have no luck in
changing any settings.
 
Another member is exploring the possibility of
changing the contents of the on-board flash through
the parallel port built in to the machine. I think
there's more possibility of success using that
approach, but it requires extra equipment that I don't
have right now.
 
The processor is a Z80-derivative, so information is
readily available on the Web. The problem is that
there could be several megabytes of code to wade
through to find the code that verifies the key, and it
may not be easy to recognize when you see it. I'm not
saying it's impossible; it's just not your typical
weekend project. I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before someone isolates that code and finds a way
around it.

Sorry! In fact I do know the difference. Somehow my fingers got ahead of

Thanks for the correction.

I just found this group. Nearly three years ago, I teamed
up with another guy somewhere out on the net to disassemble
the flash. We both worked on it fairly intensively for a couple
of weeks before we both got distracted away from the project.

We made a lot of progress, with nearly all of the first 16k
commented and understood. We located the various application
programs as well. The one thing we never figured out, though,
was the condition necessary to make the unit enter the flash
reprogramming section.

I just went through my files and emails, but unfortunately
all the work and email correspondence got lost over the years.
All I have left is the disassembly I had prior to those weeks.
Some of our discoveries were posted to the linuxhacker mailstation
area.

BTW, the code was obviously written in C and the code for
the various libraries obvious as you delve into the source.

It's hard to believe people have been working on this for so
long and still haven't figured out how to make it enter the
bootloader.

Probably hard to believe because it isn't true any more ;-)

There is Pascal code that 'Cyrano Jones' wrote which can flash new code
over the parallel port. He has used it to put a debug monitor program
on.

The one thing we don't have on that score is a way to read the existing
bootloader out before overwriting it.

I just got my laplink cable out yesterday, I want to do a little hacking
on mailstation again soon. My first goal is to get a Forth system
running on it using CJs code.


Does anyone know if the CPU has a serial port? I think it would be a
cool hack to rewire the phone port (or both ports together if one wants
flow control) as a serial port. Then with an external Y cable that
connects into both and from there to a cable or adapter. This would make
the machine much more easily interfaced with other computers, and would
probably spur some interest as a portable terminal.

I was wondering about that as well.  Is it a serial type or is it 
Parallel or some other type?

Pablo,  The better thing to use is PalmAmp.  Find an older PalmIII or 
Palm Pro and hook it up with a serial cable to run it.  Works great if 
you can mount an older laptop in the trunk and control it through the 
serial port.  Here's a link.

I have several questions regarding these specs:

| PORT definitions
| P01 = keyboard (in = cols, out = rows)
Do we have the keyboard matrix mapping?

| P02 = various
|   .7 = LCD_ON (output)
Is this part of a "sleep" mode?

|   .6 = CALLERID_DATA (input)
What is this??  I'm guessing that indicates that
caller ID data is waiting...?

|   .5 = NOT_MODEM_POWER (output)
Another part of a "sleep" mode?

|   .4 = YOUGOTMAIL_LED (output)
This is obvious.

|   .3 = LCD_CAS (output)
What is this?

|   .2 = CALLERID_DATA_RDY (input)
??  Wait... Didn't I see this above... now I'm
confused.

|   .1 = KEYROW_9 (output)
??

|   .0 = KEYROW_8 (output)
??

| P03 = software masks for ISRs: in's are interrupt
source, out's are masks. 
| Highest to lowest:
|   .7 = Caller id handler
Ok, I think I understand this one...

|   .5 = maybe RTC???
Yeah, I understand.  Now, I have questions about the
Real-Time Clock...

|   .6 = Modem handler
How much do we know about the modem?  E.g. does it
have a queue?  
Smartmodem compliant?

|   .4 = increment time16
???  What's this??

|   .3 = null
|   .0 = null
|   .1 = Keyboard handler
|   .2 = null
OK.

| P05 = slot4000page holds A14 - A21, for addresses in
#4000-7FFF range.
| P06 = slot4000device holds A22 - A29, for addresses
in #4000-7FFF range.
| P07 = slot8000page holds A14 - A21, for addresses in
#8000-BFFF range.
| P08 = slot8000device holds A22 - A29, for addresses
in #8000-BFFF range.
|Device codes:
|  0 = codeflash (64 pages)
|  1 = ram ( 8 pages)
|  2 = LCD (right half) ( 1 page )
|  3 = dataflash (32 pages)
|  4 = LCD (left half) ( 1 page )
|  5 = modem ( 1 page )
OK, I guessing that the notes "holds A22 - A29" is
bogus because of the 
device codes and should read:
  P05 = slot4000 page holds A14 - A21, for addresses
in #4000-7FFF range.
  P06 = slot4000 device code for $4000 slot
  P07 = slot8000 page holds A14 - A21, for addresses
in #8000-BFFF range.
  P08 = slot8000 device code for $8000 slot

| P09 = printer control & power detect & power button.
|   .0 = PRINTER_STROBE (output)
|   .1 = PRINTER_AUTOFEED (output)
|   .2 = PRINTER_INIT (output)
|   .3 = PRINTER_SELECT (output)
|   .4 = POWERBUTTON (input)
|   .5 = dc-dc good (input)
|   .6 = +5V good (input)
|   .7 = +6V good (input)
Clear.

| P0A = printer control direction
Um... I'm assuming that this is ALWAYS=1111.0000. 
Input is b=0, output is b=1 
(I believe that's the standard for parallel line
controllers).

| P0D = CPU clock rate control (clock is 8MHz on
reset)
|   #f0=8MHz, #30=10MHz, #00=12MHz. Resets to 8MHz. 
|   (bits: ?X?X.???? bits 6 & 4 defined/known)
Has anyone fleshed out the unknown bits?
I do find it interesting when devices select their own
clock rate: why would
anyone want anything but the fastest rate?

| P21 = printer status (db25 pins 10,11,12,13,15)
Which bits are mapped to which pin?

| P28 = various (output)
|   .0 = modem_reset
Ok, I get this.

|   .1 = 74C74_pin4_via600ohm
|   .2 = callid_dataclock
|   .3 = callid_sleep/reset
|   .4 = callid_FSK/not_DTMF
What is all of this?

|   .5 = ??
|   .6 = ??
|   .7 = ??
Has anyone done more here?

| P2C = printer data direction
Um... I'm assuming that P2C.0-7 maps to D0-7.  To
enable bidirectional PIO,
the lines have to be driven 0000.0000 for input and
1111.1111 for output.  Does
anyone know if this is compatible with APIO/PPI specs.
 It would be fun to 
connect a Zip drive.

| P2D = printer data (db25 pins 2 - 9)
Gotcha.  (Of course, I'm assuming that P2D.0-7 => D0-7

| P2F = RTC clock rate control????
Does anyone know the division rate?

| There are a few more ports not doc. here. (probably
clock/calendar?????)
Anyone know what they are?

| Just what is a "bank? Is it where memory goes, or
the memory that goes there? 
| As in "there are 2 banks, at #4000 & #8000" versus
"there are 64 banks of 
| codeflash", and "32 banks of dataflash", and "8
banks of ram".  Too avoid 
| confusion, I am calling the chunks of memory
"pages", and the places those 
| chunks are swapped into "slots". I find it too
confusing to keep calling them 
| both banks.
| There are 4 slots, of 16k each, at #0000, #4000,
#8000, & #C000.
| Only slot #4000 & slot #8000 have been observed to
be swappable, with 
| codeflash swapping into #4000, and ram into #8000. 
Also, it seems everything 
| except the ram uses #4000 slot. (LCD, dataflash,
Modem, caller ID)
| slot #0000 is always codeflash page #00
| slot #4000 is codeflash pages #01 to #3f (Or LCD,
dataflash, Modem, caller ID)
| slot #8000 is ram pages #1 to #7
| slot #C000 is always ram page #00
Okay, I'm cool with the definitions.  However, I am
unclear about several 
things:
	1) It appears that either the $4000 or the $8000 slot
can take a device 
	page. Does this mean that I can map any of the
devices to either slot?
	The slot definitions, above, say 'no'.  Therefore, I
have to assume that
	the device selector for $8000 (P08) must always =1
(RAM bank).
	2) Is it possible to have both LCD banks visible
selected at the same
	time?  (This depends on Q#1 being 'yes'.)
	3) The modem is a serial device.  Are all but the
first byte be undefined?
	4) What does the Caller ID data look like?  Is it a
string?  Is it serial
	and interupt-driven like the modem?


| On reset, slot4000 and slot8000 both contain
codeflash page 0 (dev 0, pg 0).
| I would guess that any device can swap into either
slot, but so far the ram 
| is the only thing to use #8000 slot, and it never
goes in the #4000 slot.
Okay, one question answered.  That means that the
monochrome display is fully
writable (one can actually write to the full display
without paging).

| It seems that the #0000 slot always is codeflash
page #00, & since pg #00 has 
| the bank swapping code, this makes sense.  There are
a lot of low level 
| routines in this page, too. And if the dataflash and
codeflash both swap into 
| slot #4000, then the only routines to directly
access dataflash MUST be in 
| page 0 of codeflash ...
Logical. logical. logical.
Slot $0000 appears to be the main manager for the
"operating system".

| (or copied to ram, as in update mode)
Aha!  Here's the other goodie.  The update mode seems
to be running from RAM.
So, I have several hypotheses and questions:
	1) Is the "update mode" the re-flashing function that
SJ was playing with?
	2) Has anyone found & isolated this "update mode"?
	3) This clearly means that we can execute in other
regions than $0000 and
	$4000
	
| It stands to reason that slot #C000 is fixed ram
page, since it contains the 
| stack.  Everything I have seen says that the #4000
slot is where all the 
| coderom above #003fff is mapped.

I sketched it on paper, and it is on the "todo list"
to type it up.  If you really want it, I can post it
sooner rather than later.  

In the meantime, the Matrix is 10 rows by 8 columns.
(bet you saw all three movies, and missed that! ;^)

8 of the rows are connected to output port #00,
and the other 2 are on output port #02 bits 0 & 1.

The 8 columns are read back on input port #00.

I guess so, for just the lcd.
The cpu can turn off the power to most of the
circuits (including the lcd) in what I would call the sleep mode,
but that is separate from this.
Also, some parts of the circuit can be powered down
independent of the rest (modem for instance).
I don't know for sure, but it seems a good guess that
turning the lcd off with a low to "LCD_ON" would save
power.  LCD_ON seems to be an enable for the lcd
driver circuits (inside of the lcd).

Serial data, from the caller id chip, to the cpu.

This one actually gates the power on/off to the
modem circuitry.  It seems logical that it would 
be off to save power whenever you are not using the modem.

I am not an expert on lcd's, in fact this mailstation
lcd is the first I have really looked at.  I looked
at several common lcd data sheets, and as I recall
this one did not match any of the common ones.
Since message 38, I have seen sevearal lcd's
that have a command/data pin, and I suppose
that could be the real function of this signal
(it goes directly to the lcd ribbon cable).  But
if that is the case, the only command I see 
the mailstation sending is a "column number".
I called it cas (column address select), because
it reminded me of how DRAM chips are addressed.
But it is probably better to rename it "column register select",
because the column number is sent on the data
bus (in a seperate write cycle), not on a 
multiplexed address bus as with DRAM cas.  
Maybe there *are* other commands
besides the column number, and it really *is*
"command register select"????  I dunno.

Above was the actual serial data input, *this* is
the handshake that tells the cpu to read that data.

The 2 (of 10) rows that did not fit port #01.

I dunno, but I can post the data sheet
(if it is not already there???)
The handler does implement send and recv queue's in software.

> |   .4 = increment time16
> ???  What's this??

There are two software timebases, one is a 16 bit
value, and the other is 32 bit.  The 32 bit one
seems to be counting milliseconds, but I don't
know what this one is counting (besides the
number of times that int 3.4 has happened).
The only thing that happens during
int 3.4 is this 16 bit counter is incremented.
So far, I don't know where this value is used, 
or what for.

A22-29 *is* the device code.

Although there are no pins on the cpu for a22-a29,
the device reg's can be thought of as holding those
bits.  

I have been using the notation "DDPP:XXXX"
for 32 bit mailstation addresses, where 
DD is one byte of device address (port #06 or #08),
PP is one byte of page address (port #05 or #07), and
XXXX is two bytes of slot & offset (the z80's idea of the address).

The hi two bits of XXXX determine the "slot"
(which dev & page registers to use) 
and the lo 14 bits are the offset in
page PP of device DD.

(slot0000 and slotC000 don't have writeable 
device and page registers, AFAICT, they use
fixed values, so addresses in these "slots" 
always refer to fixed pages, with 
slot0000 always holding page #00 of device #00
and
slotC000 always holding page #00 of device #01.)

The mailstation probably leaves it set that way.
Or I should say it sets it that way, and leaves it.
I would guess (but have not tried it) that you
could set any way you want, in *your* code.

Not me.

The power dissipation in CMOS devices is directly 
proportional to the clock rate.  The batteries
will last 1.5 times as long at 8 MHz.  (But it might take
1.5 times as long to do your calculation!)

> | P21 = printer status (db25 pins 10,11,12,13,15)

P21.7 in - printer status busy     (db25.11)
P21.6 in - printer status ack      (db25.10)
P21.5 in - printer status paper end(db25.12)
P21.4 in - printer status select   (db25.13)
P21.3 in - printer status error    (db25.15)

(The DB25 is a standard parallel port pinout.)

I think that 28.0 & 28.1 may be reversed????
P28.0 = connected to pin 4 of the 74c74 ic via a 600 ohm resistor.
P28.1 = modem_reset

The 74c74 is a dual flip flop, and it gates
the power to most of the board (via a transistor).
I think pulsing 28.0 will turn the board off.

callid_dataclock - the cpu toggles this line, and  
     the callid chip sends one serial bit for each clock.

callid_sleep/reset - puts the callid chip in low power sleep mode.

callid_FSK/not_DTMF - selects whether the callid chip listens for
     call id data (freq shift keyed modem-like data) or touch-tones 
(dual tone multi freq)

I don't know if they are used for anything internal,

The description above is just how the mailstation
code is using the hardware.  I have verified that
the coderom can be mapped to slot8000, and
also that ram can be mapped to slot4000.
I assume that any device can go in either slot,
but I only tested those.

Both lcd banks are visible all the time, they
are the right and left halfs of the screen.
The cpu can only access one half at a time, though.
In fact, the cpu can only access one byte (one row,
of one column, of one half the screen) at a time.

Each row is mapped to a different address in the cpu's
address space.  Changing columns within a half requires
sending a new column number to that column register thingy.
And changing halfs requires outputing a device number to
the appropriate device register.

> 	3) The modem is a serial device.  Are all but the

The modem interface to the cpu is parallel, 
one byte at a time (the uart is inside the modem chip).
When the modem is banked in, the 8 modem registers
are mapped to the first 8 bytes of whichever slot it is in
(probably mirrored throughout)  The mailstation code 
puts the modem into slot4000.

So, with the modem in slot 4000, the recv data is 
read from memory address #4000, and send data 
is written to that address.
#4001-4007 are the status and control registers.

You mean by putting one half in slot4000 and the other
half in slot8000??????

I suppose you could do that, but you would still have to deal
with the column addresses.  IOW, you cannot map all the
screen pixels into memory at the same time.  You possibly could
map one column from first half and one column from
the second half at the same time.  
(Each column is a byte wide x 128 bytes high.  And each half screen
is 20 columns wide.)

The mailstation handles this nastiness by using a screen
buffer in ram (in fixed slotC000).  All drawing is done
in this buffer, which *is* a block of bits representing the 
whole 320 x 128 pixel screen.  There are text, line, and icon
drawing routines.  

And after a whole screen is drawn another routine
copies the whole mess over to the actual lcd.
Half the screen at a time.  
One column of each half at a time.
One byte of each column at a time.

Yes, it is just that the mailstation code is assembled/linked
to run in those slots.  Your code can run wherever you like.

My code is still not ready for prime time, but I expect
too post a "beta" version "real soon now".  I tried it out
under win XP, and it does not work.  :-(

There is also a nasty tendency for the mailstation flash to be erased
if you leave the laplink cable attached while rebooting the pc.

| Maybe there *are* other commands
| besides the column number, and it really *is*
| "command register select"????  I dunno.
Ok, I can understand this... However, this is a
bit-wide: So,
the column must be selected serially.  How long is the
column
address and where is the clock port?

Do we have any information about the RTC?

| The handler does implement send and recv queue's in
software.
I don't recall seeing the document.  I think that we
need to
place the significant documents like this in the
/files folder.

| So far, I don't know where this value is used,
| or what for.
What are the port #s for these two counters?

I think that we are picking nits on semantics.
According to the 3SI176 pinout, pin #26-32 appear to
be
a port with each pin assigned to each device.  You
know
the code better than anyone else -- when selecting a
device is it a bitset or is the pinout inaccurate?

| 
| The power dissipation in CMOS devices is directly
| proportional to the clock rate.  The batteries
| will last 1.5 times as long at 8 MHz.  (But it might
take
| 1.5 times as long to do your calculation!)
Excellent point.  I believe that power consumption is
nonlinear: the faster you go the power increases
nonlinearly.  So, keeping things slow is a "good
thing."

Once again, I was using collected information I could

You know the code far better than I do.  I have made
the
change.

| P28.0 = connected to pin 4 of the 74c74 ic via a 600
ohm resistor.
| P28.1 = modem_reset
| 
| The 74c74 is a dual flip flop, and it gates
| the power to most of the board (via a transistor).
| I think pulsing 28.0 will turn the board off.
Does the board turn itself "on" through the hardware?

APIO = Advanced Parallel I/O
PPI should be ECP/EPP (sorry)
It may actually work... You stated that you can
reprogram
the MS using the parallel port.  Do you manage to do 
bidirectional communication to-from the PC/MS?

There is good reason for this. LCDs tend to be slow to update, so it's
better to do some things with it off in some cases. They may not use this,
but you never know.

Actually, your #1 matches my #1, and your #2 matches
my numbers #2 and #3.  I wanted to be very specific,
and maybe that lost some of the meaning.
Does that help?

Sounds interesting.  By firmware spec, do you mean
essentially a datasheet for the mailstation hardware?

I typed it and uploaded to file section.  Also
another modem datasheet, and a revised verion of my lcd
data.

The lcd interface is byte wide.  
Column numbers are sent as bytes.
And pixel data is sent 8 pixels per byte.

The columns are 8 pixels wide by 128 pixels high.

2 halfs x 20 columns/half x 8 pixels/column = 320 pixel wide screen.

[...blah, rtc, blah...]

> Do we have any information about the RTC?

I'm pretty sure that i/o ports #10 thru #1F are for the rtc.
The date & time digits are #10-#1C, and the last 3 
are some sort of control.

[...modem...]

done.  I skimmed thru it again, and it would seem 
that the modem in the ms is capable of controling a 
speakerphone, and the interfacing to a headset, too.
Hmmmm.

No ports, they are in ram.

On the software side, it is the binary address.

To select device 5 (the modem), the device register
holds "0000 0101"

You are correct that the device bits are decoded 
internally to a "1 of 7", and the device address 
bits never make it outside the cpu.  And it is
impossible to add even an 8th device, coz the
whole device reg & decoder is buried in the chip.
(There is one device select unused and available for
expansion purposes, device 6).

[......................]

> | I think pulsing 28.0 will turn the board off.
> Does the board turn itself "on" through the hardware?

Yes, but not with that same signal.  It can wake itself
up at a set time, and download mail.  And as far as I 
can tell, the cpu is sleeping, or off, before wakeup.
So it can't wake itself up with a i/o bit.  
It must be a timer, likely part of the rtc.

[....]

My hunch is that it is just a matter of writing
the software.  The data pins on the parport are
capable of bidir communication.

Yes, but the ms update code uses a "laplink" type
of protocol.  It requires the minimum in parports,
and will work with even the oldest par ports.  It
does not use real bidir capability, it receives
5 bits at a time using the status lines as inputs.

each byte is 8 horizontal pixels.

It does have its own memory. 
(2 halfs x 20 cols  x 128 rows x 8 pixels).

no.

check the revised lcd data in file section, under "part files".

Essentially, yes.  A firmware specification does
define all the hardware elements in an embedded
system, but it goes further to describe the:
-Support devices and their programming
   +flash devices
   +RTC
   +display
   +modem
   +keyboard
   +parallel port
   +caller ID
   +LEDs
   +power modes
-Interrupt subsystem
   +priorities
   +masking
   +stacking
-Paging mechanisms and rules
   +slots & pages
-Ports -- their meaning and programming
   +...?
-Clocking: RTC and clock interrupts (if they exist)
   +timers
   +wake-ups
   +MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.mmm

Many of the items above are still in flux, but I could
gather what we know right now into a useful
programmers document.  I would like to get to the
point of being able to completely reprogram the MS
with my own OS and programming language(s).  This is
the first step in that direction.  That is the reason
I put that poll up -- I wanted to see if publishing
this would be useful to more than myself alone.

-Sean

Sean,

Useful, certainly, but most of us can get along with an I/O map, memory
map and the datasheets, so if I were you I wouldn't put too much effort
into polished engineering documentation. Just the essentials will
suffice for those who will be writing code.

Where hard questions come up, one just disassembles the original
firmware.

Maybe better just to start hacking and document peculiarities as you go?
I always figured the linux-hacker stuff looked sufficient to start
getting code up and running. It certainly helped point the way to the
native reflash code.

(CJ -- I haven't forgotten about porting/testing the reflash code, alas
I am just swamped with end-of-year bookkeeping stuff at the moment...)

I am able to do the Shift-FN-T trick during power on to setup one 
user.  Is there any way to setup more via a similar method?

I was too late for the poll, but for starters I would like to:

1) Be able to flash the device with new firmware

2) Modify firmware to unlock all User settings

3) Modify firmware to allow more than one user

4) Reflash unit with the two changes above

Which model do you have? Surprised you can't set up 5 users.

Has anyone been able to make use of the MyCIDCO Info part of a stock
mailstation? I have mine set up to receive my POP3 e-mail just fine,
but it would also be nice to be able to use the Info part. Would it be
possible for me to set up a website so my mailstation can go out and
get the weather, news, etc. just like it would if hooked to Earthlink?
If so, how?

Thanks!

What mailstation do you have?  Thats been the $64000 question I've had 
all along is how to spoof this thing into going to another POP3 server.

Does anyone want to buy 1 or 2 blue Mailstations as new?  One is new in 
box.  Neither has been registered.  I just won one of the older ones 
that will fill my needs better.

Offers?  Trades?  Audreys?  Model 100s?

Hi Ronny,
I have the Mivo 350 Cordless V.1.35 (black).  I received mine
yesterday, went into setup, deleted out the previous user's info and
was able to change everything. I am wanting it for my mother who
wants something simple just for e-mail. (My father has an ISP for
business, so she has her own POP3 e-mail account.)  She's now using a
3com Audrey which I fixed for her.  Problem is that Audrey is very bad
about dialing up, getting e-mail, but not hanging up in a timely
manner.  (This Mailstation dials, gets e-mail, then hangs up
immediately!)

I just thought it would also be nice to be able to give her a little
bonus with the MyCIDCO Info stuff.  I have been to
www.linux-hacker.net and wasn't able to find anything about MyCIDCO. 
There was a lot of info on going to another POP3 and much other type
of hacking.

Unfortunatley I bought two of the "Blue" ones.  These are locked down to 
the Earthlink servers.  I really don't think it's possible yet to 
reflash it.  I bought one off eBay that is the non wireless version I 
think will work for what I wanted to do.

I can't give you a guarantee BUT, experience teaches me that all of these
units from the Mivo 100 and up will reflash with the same hardware and
possibly the same software. Why re-invent the wheel? So once that's cracked,
they'll all be open. Early investigation shows that there is plenty of ROM
space unused - enough for a Basic interpreter for example.

How would that be done?  What other equipment would I have to get to 
reflash one of these?

Someone is going to figure this out an build a reflash station. But it'll be
someone with in depth knowledge of electronics and Z-80 code. Once he does
this, you'll all be sending your Mailstations in to be 'fixed'. I want to
convert mine into a sort of super Radio Shack model 100 computer.

This is not a job to do-it-yourself.

Neil

Actually, I saw a special test clip for the TSOP flash parts like those
in the Mailstation a few months back, I may be able to dig up the link.
Just solder some wires and connect it to a programmer properly, I think
you would be set. More efficient than having to use a rework station to
lift the part and add a part w/ a documented bootloader/flash burn code


Of course if all the units can be reflashed through the software
mechanisms we're better off all around. I just have to get around to
testing CJs code on my various units. Too many projects.

I'm assuming they can be reflashed via the parallel printer port, since it
seems to be clear that the code is there to do that.

There's code there, but there's no guarantee that it is in all versions
of the ROM, or that all versions behave the same, or that future
firmware revisions/updates won't rip it out.

The parallel port routines are sort of a developer's back-door. As you
know, in the field the units are upgraded via special cryptographically
protected email messages. So they could take this stuff out any time,
unless it's part of their manufacturing process.

But I imagine they would be assembling the boards with the parts already
programmed.

Basically, we just need to verify it with CJs code. Everything is in
place to move forward, it's just a matter of who has time to get it
done.

That's too bad. The Yahoo ones are best, up to 5 accounts on any ISP.

What is the ROM version?  Is the hardware model a DET1 also?

Don't know, but a Yahoo! symbol comes up on the screen.

Is the hardware model a DET1 also?

I thought so. Did you check the links on
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/ ??

It displays it under Settings.  On mine you go to extras off the Main 
Menu and then Settings.  The upper right shows XTND on or off and 
then the version of the ROM.

On mine there is a sticker on the bottom stating the model.

Hello,

I have always had problems using search engines to find what I
wanted,as it always poped up results that I was in no way looking for.
I just happen to go through a very simple page, with relavent links on
computing and felt that it could be useful to you too. You may go to
http://www.yahoouk.org/computing for the computing catalog with the
following sub areas : Computer Hardware, Computer Peripherals,Computer
Programming,Computer Security,Computer Services,Computer Storage

I have uploaded a current copy of my remote debugger 
to the files section (a DOS executable, mailbug.exe).

It includes code to flash the remote target code
(MBOOT/MBUG) into a mailstation.  I have tested
it on version 2.22r and 2.53yr.  It should work with 
2.54, too.  I don't know about any of the others, 
but it might.  You need a parallel laplink cable to 
use it.  I think a windows DCC (direct cable connect)
is essentially the same thing.

If you don't feel adventurous, it should be possible 
to make a version that is more likely to work on
unknown versions, it just is not done yet.

It also includes a "RAM" target, that emulates only the
mailstation ROM (you don't need to connect to real mailstation).
This will allow "on the fly" disassembly of the rom code,
including comments, but not execution.  (unzip don
hamiltons dump in subdir "hamilton", and debugger
will convert it to .rom files.)

Installing the MBUG target will erase most of the
mailstation code, but the low level stuff is preserved.
MBUG will allow on the fly disassembly, uploading to
ram, and executing, among other things.  Breakpoints
still do not work.

There is also an extremely simple "hello world" program 
(both .asm & .hex). It makes a call to a system routine, 
and displays on the LCD.

The source code is included for the remote part, with
an explanation of how it (remote) works.  The source 
for the PC side is not included, 'cause it is not ready yet.  
There is no documentation on using it yet either, but
the menu should help.  

It uses the same code I posted earlier (unit_tribbles.pas)
but with new timeout code that should work regardless
of cpu speed now.  And it is still a DOS app (just be glad
it is not still CP/M!!!).  If anyone knows how to turn
tribbles.pas into a win32 device driver, then I could
make a win32 version.

I only included comment file for page #00 of the rom
for now.  I have a lot more, but it is taking time to get
everything in order.  I hope to post more soon.  But I
wanted to get something out now.

I'm sure I have forgot something....

Oh, if something goes wrong, you could toast your
mailstation.  I now have 4 units with unbootable rom code.

And I would highly advise not to leave the laplink
connected between your PC and the mailstation when
booting the PC.

Well, I loaded MBOOT/MBUG on a Mailstation DET1 ver 2.54Y. The screen on 
the mailstation now says "Welcome to Mbug", which I assume is a good thing.

How do I load the "Hello World" program?

Correct!
 
> How do I load the "Hello World" program?

First make sure the target is set to "MBUG", and not "RAM".
The T key toggles between the two.

Then either set the "workfile" with W key, type hello.hex
(or just proceed with load, and enter filename when it asks.)

Next type L 4000
(as in "Load 4000)

Then type G 4000
(as in "Go 4000)

And it should execute the extremely short program, 
which calls the display routine, and then jump back 
into MBUG (it leaves MBUG in control when done).

For the addresses, you can also specify the device 
and page, or else it will use whatever device/page 
is at the z80 address  you give.  

You can enter a path with the filename, but the default 
dir is the 253yr subdir, and that is where hello.hex is.  
There is also a z80 cross assembler (dos) in the mbug 
directory.

Unplug the power!

The mailstation shuts off under software control,
and that sowtware is not running now, so the
power button does nothing.

I was wondering what os/cpu/mhz you are running under?

Do the comments display with the disassemble command (D xxxx)?

Disassembly works with either the mbug or ram targets, 
but it is slower with mbug because it is pumping the
code over the laplink as it scrolls down screen.

I should have figured that out about the power.  I guess there is some 
work left to do :-)

I am running it on a Toshiba T4700CS laptop, 50mhz 486, Win 95.  Runs 
fine in a dos window.

I am seeing comments when I disassemble.  I assume the code is coming 
out of the mailstation, and the comments out of a file. I guess this is 
something to be aware of in case you change something.

Do you have any advice on how not to trash the mailstation when 
writing/loading/running applications?

Does the mailstion 250 have a Z80?  I have a 350, but it has some 
toshiba 16 bit processor, so I'm getting rid of it.  The interesting 
thing is that for wireless devices, the FCC has tons of stuff online, 
like schematics.  All you need is the FCC Id. Maybe some of it for the 
250 would apply to other devices as well.

CJ, where are you located?  I'm in North Carolina, USA.

I'm not sure how well such a clip would work, given the low profile of a
TSOP flash part, but if it does work wouldn't that mean one could
reprogram a toasted mailstation flash chip without desoldering the part?

It won't be hard to get it to shut off, I just
haven't tried.  Actually, I don't think it ever
really shuts itself off in "normal" use,  I think
it just "goes to sleep".  

Try "G 1AC0"
That will execute what I believe the ms does
when it "turns off".  My screen went blank when
I tried it!  I thought I would have to power cycle
or reset to get it back, but the power button
wakes it up!!! 

I actually leave mine on most of the time, running
with the wall-wart.   (And that has been how I 
killed 3 of the 4.)  If you are using batteries, I
guess you need to take them out to get it 
completely off.

That's cool.  I hadn't even thought about that end
of the spectrum. :-)    How much ram is in it?
The debugger allocates over 3 meg of buffers,
and it probably should run with a disk cache
(win 95 provides one, right???) because the comment
files are not buffered inside of the program 
(and it reads them from the beggining every
time screen scrolls.)

Right.  If you installed the v2.53 files, and converted
to .rom files, then you can use the "ram" target, and
browse the disassembly/comments, and the code
will be read from pc ram, and it is noticeably
faster.  I started to add the concept of "projects"
so you could have different versions use different
comment files, but that is not done yet.

I'm just distributing the comment files, without
the disassembly, because I don't want to
worry about any copyright issues.
 
If you use command ^h it will render the disassembly
and comments to a hyperlinked .html files.  I don't
know how long it will take at 50 MHz to do pages
00 thru 3f, but you can tell it to do just page 00.
(I recommend using ram target for this.  But it
should work from mbug, just slower.)

> Do you have any advice on how not to trash the 
> mailstation when writing/loading/running applications?

The first one I trashed was due to me asking the
debugger to erase a page that held part of the 
then-current bootup code.  The only way to avoid 
that is to be careful.  :-)  :-)

The second and third were due to changes I 
made to keep the mailstation from getting locked up
when rebooting the PC.  Previously it had
been thru countless reboots, with the
only ill effect being that it was unresponsive to
commands, and required a hard reset.  

I was getting tired of having to 
poke a pencil in the reset hole.  I
figured what was happening was that
either windows or the PC firmware was
"printing" some garbage to the parallel port
during boot up (you know how a printer will
sometimes print garbage when a PC is booting.)
So, I added some error detection, making
the remote code restart whenever it got
a command that didn't make sense.  All I
can figure is that what happened is that
I gave the gibberish a fresh shot from
the start everytime it sent nonsense,
making it much more likely to hit on the
command "erase page 00" eventually.

The first time it happened I really didn't
know what had happened.  I grabbed a
new mailstation, and installed the very same
version of mboot.  Within a week that one
was toast, too.  I figured it must have something
to do with the most recent changes.  So
I decided I should fix it before wrecking
another mailsation.  In the meantime, I
was fiddling with a stock mailstation 
(without my code) trying to read the serial
number thru the laplink (that works!).

But I left the thing connected (and powered)
when I was done.  Several days went by,
with several pc reboots, and then one day
I noticed that this *stock* mailstation
had apparently gotten erased.  Live and learn.

I now *unplug* the laplink when I quit
the debugger (It now displays a 
reminder when quitting!)
I actually thought I had fixed it
so this couldn't happen, but as I
look at the code now, it appears that
the reminder is how I fixed it.
If only I had the time to do everything I
want to...

But I havent had any problem since
December.  The next version should
have a better safeguard.

There really is no way to prevent
a haywire program from finding the reflash 
code, other than removing it completely.
I mean, even if you thought you had
a secure lockout, what if the program
running amok jumps in right after the lock?
But I don't think we really need to worry
about that.  Just unplug the laplink when
you are done, for now!  And brown
mailstations are real cheap on ebay. :-)
 
> Does the mailstion 250 have a Z80?  

Yes.  It's essentially the same as the
brown/white/100's.  Except for the
modem, and the radio circuitry.  And
keyboard.  And callerid chip.  But the 
cpu/ram/codeflash/dataflash are the same.

> I have a 350, but it has some

I'll bet you can get over $100 for it on
ebay.  I've seen several sell in the $130 range.

The 350 appears to use some other
protocol (if any) for it's update function.

Yes!  Where is the search page?  I saw the link
on linux hacker for the 350 data.  But I can't
find a search page that will return that page.
Is there any reason we shouldn't look at this,
like with the patent info?

We already have most of the port/pinout/address info
courtesy of rogblake, and one friendly panther
(who I understand almost went blind tracing the circuit).

OUCH!  Did you see the price on those?  You could 
buy 20 or 30 mailstations for that price!  :-)

I am sure you can rescue a misflashed mailstation
without removing the chip.  It's just not gonna be
real easy.  

I was thinking that the ram chip would be the easiest
place to get at the bus, like in Don Hamilton's pic
in the groups photo section.  Just solder wires to it!

I don't know about just driving the bus and flashing,
but what I was thinking was to connect the data bus
to the data pins on a pc parallel port, and maybe the
/rd or /ce, or an address line or two, to the status
pins.  You would need to cut the /ce to the flash, and
pull the flash side of it high, and monitor the other 
side of it.

Then, with a fast pc, emulate the codeflash.  Send
code for the cpu to execute, and have it load 
whatever you want into ram, then jump to it.  
After your arbitrary code was running from
ram, disconnect the pc from the bus, and reconnect
the /ce to the codeflash chip.

Then the code in ram can flash whatever it needs to
into the codeflash.  This technique would
give you access to any device, not just
a trashed mailstation.  You could even use
it to access/download the rom before erasing
any of the unknown ms firmware versions.

Maybe there is some socket with the right pitch
to mate with that ram chip?  It wouldn't need to
snap on, you could just hold it on for the instant
it would take to load the ram.  A through-hole
type rather than surface mount might work
even better (use the solder side pins to contact 
the ram, and solder your wires to the component side).

(It might be easier to just piggyback a similar 
packaged preprogrammed rom on to the ram, with 
its /cs connected to the codeflash /cs, but I don't
have such a chip, or a programmer for it.)

Anybody able to identify the type of package
for the ram chip?  I am by no means an expert 
on surface mount packages.  Is it a SOP?  SSOP??
TSOP-II???

Whats the difference between all those anyhow???
The fact that different manufacturers seem
to use different names for the same packages
doesn't help.

I got source for mailbug some time back, and I've built it for Linux.

No luck burning mbug into the flash though.

Do I have to put the MS into a special mode before running the flash
burn software?

Fn-Shift-T gets me to a diagnostics menu, but there is no entry there
regarding flash programming (just various tests).

Well with shipping on each one I think it would be more like 10 or 15,
but yeah. It ain't free.

But then such a solution would work in all cases, no matter how hose the
MS, and whether or not the built-in flash routine is accessible. Only
one of us would have to own one, and could reprogram MS's for others.

I heard about this particular test clip from someone that reprograms
firmware on certain tv receivers.

Great!  How did you handle the port permission issue???

No, just turn it on.  As far as I can tell, the ms can 
be on any screen when you kick it into the update mode.
You do not need to touch the mailstation (other than
to turn it on, and connect the laplink).

The PC will make the ms enter/leave update mode
via the laplink.  The only commands you need to 
type are on the PC keyboard.

When the update is done, the ms reboots to the 
main menu, unless you erased the ms code.  

Make sure you can read out the serial number
before you try to flash.  That will tell you if
you are sending and receiving ok.  Each time
you read sn, it will enter update mode, display
sn on pc screen, and then the ms reboots when
the update mode exits.

Maybe there exists a need for some documentation???   ;^)

I got a bunch for betwwen $0.01 & $1.00, plus s/h.
I figure the average price I paid might be about $8.00
after shipping.  I got a box of 10 150's, shipped for
$50.00 total.  :-)

But the price seems to have gone UP on ebay this
week.  <heh, heh>

Crap... I was afraid of that... that means one of the following:

1) laplink cable problem (I bought a manufactured cable) or
2) Timing issue or
3) The bytes aren't really making it out the port or
4) There's something broken about my serial port

Uh, well that would help. Also if you have any debugging ideas, that

I don't think you need the iopl(3),
just the ioperm(888,2,1).  888 is the decimal address of lpt1,
the 2 means 2 consecutive ports, and I believe 888 & 889
are all I used.  And the one means "grant access", right???
And I think you have to be root to do the ioperm.  

Are you USEing the plain "linux" unit (I think that is the name)???
None of the examples I see mention the "oldlinux",
and I think ioperm is in "linux".  Maybe it just a newer
version than in "oldlinux".  What's the scoop on why
oldlinux is necessary???

As far as I can tell, after the ioperm, you can use the ports
unit, and that's what unit_tribbles uses for port access.

Do you know for sure what the port address is for your
parallel port????  888 is the most common, but there
are others.  I think we have another candidate for the config
file!!!!

Can you test the port with some other software?  (And
a printer).

Are you sure it is Parallel Laplink and not serial???
They make both!

What do you get on your screen???  Any timeout errors?

You could try making a simple test program that
toggles the dataport pins, and check with logic
probe (or LED port tester thingy), and see if
that works (eliminates cable and mailstation from
the equation).

But the first thing I would try is skipping oldlinux & the iopl(3).

I think we are figuring out the docs as we go!!!  We
can compile the questions, or at least answers into
some kind of manual.

OK.  I see what the oldlinux is about.  They did away 
with the linux unit.  And replaced it with a handful of
other units.  I found the new ioperm in unit "X86".

But apparently "oldlinux" *IS* the "linux" unit, renamed.
And it should work.  But I found this in the oldlinux
manual:
--------------------------------------------
IoPL
Set I/O privilege level
Declaration
Source position: linuxold.inc line 1558
 function IoPL(
   Level: LongInt
 ):Boolean;

Description
IoPL sets the I/O privilige level. It is intended for completeness 
only, one should normally not use it. 
---------------------------------------------

How do you call ioperm???  Does it return error???
It should return "true" if it worked, and "false"
if it failed.  Do you check it???


writeln('gonna ask for ioperm...');

if not (ioperm(888, 3, 1)) then 
begin
  writeln('didn''t get it.  damn.  gonna halt now.');
  Halt(1);
end;

writeln('Hot dang!  We got it!!!');
delay(1000);

It didn't work until I put the iopl in. I didn't think I needed it
either, but I was getting access violations until I put it in.

Yeah I was ignoring the return code. Your way is better in case someone
decides to run it and they aren't root you can give them an error
message.

Any luck yet? 

> 4) There's something broken about my serial port

You meant parallel, right???  :-)

It just occured to me that the port tester I used was
for rs232.  All 25 pins go straight thru, and the 9
lines used by rs232 have leds.  

7 of the 10 laplink signals fall on a line with led,
and the 5 laplink-out bits are on the first 5 leds.
I eventually modified it so all 10 laplink signals 
were monitored with a led, but it was extremely 
useful even before mod.  

The PC will use pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to talk *to* the 
mailstation.  2, 3, 4 are the 3 bit tribble, 5 is busy,
and 6 is strobe to mailstation.  pin 5 ("busy") will go
high when the pc is talking to mailstation.

The mailstation talks back to PC using pins 
15, 13, 12, 10, 11.  10 is ms busy, 11 is strobe
to PC.

Both sides raise busy when they want to talk, and
both sides also raise busy briefly to acknowledge
they have been strobed.

You mentioned you had a rs232 tester, right?  It
will tell you if your bits are getting out of the box,
as long as it has leds for pins 5 & 6.

OOPS!  I was wrong when I said it worked unmodified.

Your question about ground made me wonder what my tester
was using for it's ground reference, since rs232 ground 
is pin 7, and pin 7 is not ground on the parport.

I forgot about another little change I had made, before 
it worked at all.  

The common of the resistor pak in my rs232 tester was 
originally tied to pin 7 of the db25 (rs232 signal ground).  

I cut the trace between that common resistor pin and 
db25 pin 7 (it is connected to pin 7 of both db25's,
so if you do this, make sure you cut it loose from both).

Then I added a piece of kynar from that common resistor
pin to one of the db 25 pins that is ground on the 
parallel port (I used pin 24, but pins 18 thru 25 are 
all ground on the PC parport.)

> I did buzz out my laplink cable; does this look correct/sufficient?:

I made some annotations on your pinout, below. 
Recheck those two, maybe its OK.

My cable does not have the * connections, but 
several pinouts found on the 'net do.  I thought 
it odd that the  pin 1's would be connected straight 
thru, since pin 1 is an output on both sides.  

It turns out that those 4 pins are the control
port (outputs).  I understand that they are
open collector, so tying together is ok, and
you can read as an input as long as you set 
the coresponding out bit high. 
(Mailstation doesn't use them)

Here is how the laplink maps to a serial tester
(need to make the ground mod to tester).  

At the PC end, the outputs to mailstation are:
    data 0 = pin 2 = TD
    data 1 = pin 3 = RD
    data 2 = pin 4 = RTS
      busy = pin 5 = CTS
    strobe = pin 6 = DSR

The inputs do not fall on either of the other two LEDs.
pin  8 = CD
pin 20 = DTR

I don't know if the shell of the connector is connected
to the signal ground???  Likely is, but I am not sure.
Pins 18 thru 25 are all signal ground though, so I would
put black on one of them.

Well I've made a temporary retreat. Dealing with Linux and an unmodified
mailstation is adding to many variables at once.

I rebuilt my laptop with win98 and am using your current released binary
from albatross.zip.

So I run mailbug, enter u, then S

I get "Mailstation did not ACK the dataflash command"

So I was very brave and typed 

^f

This does something! 

"The software update process is ready to start, please wait"

appears on the mailstation screen, then immediately afterward it changes
to "Please check that the mailstation cable is properly connected and
try again."

On the laptop DOS box I see 

Here we go....
No codeflash command ACK, moderesult: 79
Can't enter codeflash mode.

The firmware revision on this unit is V3.03a. Nothing got hosed by the
failed update attempt. The unit still works fine.

Is this the same machine you were trying the Linux version on?

If you type Ctrl-t (toggles debug mode) you will get more
verbose info from most commands.  Here you would get
the value of whatever the pc receives as acknowledge
to the "enter dataflash mode" command.  The two
values the ms might send are either #06 (ascii ACK),
or #15 (ascii NAK).

For codeflash mode, it displays the byte it receives in response
to the command without "debug on", but it is in decimal here.
Just one of many rough edges left to be smoothed.  

79  =  #4F  =  x01 001 111  is what you got, 
when we are expecting either
ACK  =  #06  =  x00 000 110    or
NAK  =  #15  =  x00 010 101
where the x represents the unused bit of the third tribble.
(bytes are sent as three groups of three bits.)

Maybe it is a problem with the settling time on the port bits???
Your cpu could be fast enough to read the port before they
have had time to stabilize????  OR!  It could be that your
low order bit of the three data bits is pegged high?????

ACK is  x00 000 110    and if you set the lowest bit of each 
tribble high you get x01 001 111  =  #4F  =  79 dec.

This will be easy enough to check.  Maybe I should add a
loopback test???  Then you could make up a plug to feed 
the outs back into the ins on the parallel port. 

That way we can be sure we're talking to the port, without
the mailstation (or cable) in the loop.

I would not try to flash anything until I could read the
serial number out reliably.  The SN command requires
sending 12 bytes in (with checksum) and receiving 
18 bytes back.  With no danger if it fails.

Erasing the codeflash takes just two bytes in.

> The firmware revision on this unit is V3.03a. Nothing got hosed by the

Also, until we see the code in 3.03a, we don't know if
we are putting mboot in a location where it will be called
for sure.  I had an idea to create an image that fills
every high page with nops, and a jump to mboot at the
end.  That way, wherever it jumps/calls will run mboot.

HEY!!!  I just looked up the pin for your stuck bit, and it
is 15, and that is one of the two that were wrong in
your cable pinout.  Maybe your cable *is* bad!!!

Mailstation did not ACK the dataflash command


With ^f I get:

No codeflash command ACK, moderesult: 79
Can't enter codeflash mode.


Interestingly, if the mailstation is in this state "please check that

Crap, I think you're right... one way it's 15-2, the other way it's
15-NC. Of course that would mean that behavior should be different
connected the other way. Have to try that...

Anyway I guess I'll build a damn cable. That's what I get for buying
this 4 months ago and not doing anything with it...

OK, better now.

With Win98, I can now get the serial # from the unit. I bought a new
laplink cable from Fry's, and this one doesn't have a dead 15-2
connection so it works :-)

As to Linux, I haven't tried it yet, but I have some theories: one, I
don't know why I didn't think of this, but maybe the print server (lpd)
is holding onto the port in some way. Which would cause some kind of
problem. The deal is that I am able to share the printer port with my
Rio PMP300 player, so I guess I didn't think about possible consequences
of reusing the port.

Alternatively, maybe I am writing to the port, but perhaps it is in some
non standard mode, like epp mode? Does unit_tribble set the mode of the
port?


Now, I haven't tried the reflash command. 3.03a... not as brave now that
I know I'm actually communicating... do you think I should just give it
a shot, or do you have some ideas for an image that is more likely to
work?

Never mind; I just went for it, and mailbug seems to be running now
quite happily.

Now what can I put on it... have as anyone tried compiling any programs
for it? I was thinking about compiling some C code with sdcc and trying
to run it on there.

Great!!!  :-)   :-)   :-)

So far, I have only used assembler, and not much more
than the "hello world" (hello.asm & hello.hex)

W hello.hex
L 4000
G 4000

The source (and an assembler) is in the mbug directory.
The mbug/mboot source is there, too.  I think I even
zipped up the .bat file to build them.  The bat files
need the dir set, I do that by just making "shortcuts"
to the bat files (set properties to "close on exit").

If you put the .hex or .rom files in the 253yr dir, you
can load them without typing a path.  The bat files 
output the .hex or .rom's to 253yr, and .lst to mbug dir.

I have started on a "next version" of mboot, but I am 
finding a few bugs in mailbug.  Load didn't work right
always.  If you try to load a .rom over 256 bytes, it 
puts the bytes past 256 into the next page!!!  I got that
fixed in mine.  I also discovered that the write to flash
(Z) is broke.  I am still trying to get to the bottom of it.

There has been a lot of change in the code since the last 
time I used Z command, so I am not sure how I broke it.
I'd really like to fix that too, and then post a new
mailbug.

It looks like you've put together an excellent programmer's tool! I look
forward to whatever improvements you can provide. For now though at
least we all have a way to load code!

I will let you know if I get the linux version working, maybe we can get
some more people hacking on the MS if we get a stable set of tools for
target development under Linux. From my end, I'd also like to get a
"device" target (basically a C standard library) developed under sdcc.
Sdcc can already generate Z80 code, but there of course is no MS target
yet.

Maybe in a few months we'll be able to completely replace the MS
hardware access routines with our own.

I have it figured out now.... Apparently you can't use code
in one part of the flash to write to another part.  I thought
as long as it was in a different sector it would be ok.  In
retrospect, it seems kinda dumb to even try it.  I think
the flash chip may be busy running it's internal programming
algorithm, and all you are supposed to do is try to read back
the byte you are attempting to flash.  You probably cannot
access any other location till it's done!

In the earliest versions, I just copied the rom to ram,
like the ms does, and then I called the sector write
from mbug.

While experimenting with writing text to the LCD, I had
mbug map the update code directly into Slot8000 (the only
fonts left after reflash are in that update code).  
The LCD routines worked fine that way, running directly
from the rom.  (I have a halfway-decent scrolling text
screen, now!)

It only seemed natural to just use the sector write the
same way...

I was lazy, and didn't want to rewrite what seemed good
enough.  I think the right way to do it now is just add
the actual flash code into mbug.

:-)

I may have something better in a few days, but for now, if anyone is 
tying to use it, as far a I can tell the hex file load is working ok
in the old version (what number did I post, 0.0.1 or 0.0.2 ????).
You can assemble a file (orged #4000) to a .hex file, load it
at #4000, (L 4000) and then execute it with the go command
(G 4000).

[.....]

I am looking forward to seeing what other people might be able
to get going.  As far as the C standard library, I think that is
what most of the low level mailstation code is.  

I have done some experiments where I have made calls to
several of the low level routines.  I've been imagining making 
an include-file for the assembler, with the EQU's for the 
usefull addresses.  Is this the kind of thing you would 
use a c "header file" for???

Is it possible to both change to a different ISP, and ALSO to retain

I am guessing I should follow the instructions from a prior

the DET-1? The below instructions were for an "original black model"

If I dump the system data, how do I set up the Yahoo! service?

Set up a second user for the second service. AFAIK, the Yahoo! service is
long gone.

You must have a newer unit then. I have a Yahoo one and I can set up any ISP
and 5 users.

Neil

Here are some notes on some models:-

FN+Shift+T or FN+Shift+Size are for MailStation 100

===================================================
If you press Function + d (on the MS 150, V4.04D) and press the
hard reset button (with a paper clip) you'll get a slightly different
menu dialog (the "Reset System Data" menu) after the memory scan? You
have to keep holding Function + d after the reboot to see it.
The menu shows an additional item: "Restore Default Account".

===================================================
I figured out how to get into the setup menu on my Mailstation 350.

Remove the batteries and use only the ac adapter to power the unit.

Perform a reset to factory default settings by pressing and holding
down the keys <Function + D> and power up. Select Yes when asked to
restore to factory settings.

During the message "Please wait while system resets" unplug the ac
adapter. This corrupts the settings in memory so that the unit will
now only bring up the setup menu.

The setup menu asks for User Name, Dial Up Number, Reply to address,
and E-mail address. There is also a Network settings button that
appears in the menu. Unfortunatly it will not let you put in an e-
mail address or allow you to go to the Network menu. I'm guessing
there is some combination of keystrokes or some hidden way to allow
access to those settings but I haven't been able to figure it out.

===================================================
Good work Jeff. I could perform the reset with batteries as well.
All I did was to to use a pin inserted on the little hole on the
back to press the reset button during the message "Please wait
while system resets". Then, press Fnct-D keys during the next
power on.


===================================================
A Mivo 250 uses Fcn-Shift-SIZE!!! Not T!!!

===================================================
Great news! I was able to configure a Mailstation (black) original model to
work with Access-4-Free, a free (10hrs month) ISP!

Interesting. I guess I never realized that about industrial flash
chips... now that I think about it, the only time I've ever written to
it was while running from RAM. So I'd say this behavior kind of stinks,
but I don't doubt it to be the case. Certainly you would think that
other sectors would be unaffected by a write to another sector, but I
guess they aren't that sophisticated.

Yes, I agree. But it will be nice to have a complete independent set of
firmware, then we will know we have a foundation that can't be changed
under us.

Yes, a header file and possibly a C wrapper library to go with it,
depending on the calling conventions of the low level routines.

Hi

Well, the instructions below worked fine (DET-1 is the "original" 
model, I guess!) 

Now I have a new problem. I am using the unit to access a POP3 
account (deluxe version of Yahoo! mail) and so I entered in 
pop.mail.yahoo.com for the POP3 setting. And of course 
smtp.mail.yahoo.com for the outgoing server setting.

Guess who can receive mail on his Mailstation, but not send it!

The Yahoo help site says that "some Internet service providers will 
block port 25. If you experience technical problems sending email, 
then you will need to use port 587 when sending via Yahoo!'s SMTP 
server."

Ug...I have no idea whether that's the real problem, and if it is, 
how to go about changing the port!

Any one have ideas??

Thanks

Maybe you could try configuring your desktop client to dial up and talk
to Yahoo. If that doesn't work then the port is probably blocked, in
which case you'll need to find a proxy server which will forward your
SMTP packets.

For a more direct test, you can usually use telnet (on desktop) to
connect to arbitrary TCP ports, in this case 25. Try hittng enter, or
HELO (or ELHO?) you should get a response from the server. If you are
able to connect and get a response then your ISP is not blocking port
25.

Not sure how to change the port (if it's possible at all)

Two possibilities - smtp.mail.yahoo.com isn't the outgoing system, OR the
password is wrong. Neither SHOULD be possible, but strange things do happen.
I was able to hook one of these up to my ISP OK.

The datasheet doesn't directly say that you can't do this,
but it is the only explanation I can think of.  The symptom 
was that mbug rebooted when I tried either erase or flash
operations.  The sector would be erased ok, but when trying
to flash, only one byte would be flashed.  Thats consistent 
with what I would expect if the cpu lost access to the code 
it was running after issuing the erase or byte program commands.

I uploaded my test program here:

It reads the keyboard, and displays the key scancode on the LCD.

Hi, I just got an old Mailstation... what can it be used for now?  Or
is there some FAQ that I missed answering the question already?

Given MAILBUG, and an assembly language program, it can currently be
used for just about anything, since code can now be loaded onto the unit
over the parallel port.

If an sdcc target can be made for mailstation, it will become possible
to compile C programs for it.


If you're not a hacker, for many mailstations you can make it call an
alternate ISP and pretty much does what it does today, but with your own
ISP.

Our local Ofice Max is selling a pile of -new- leftover mailstations
for $9 each. I bought the wireless model Mivo 250 and it does not
function as I see notes on the other models seem to. Perhaps it is a
newer one?
It is CIDCO model DET28

Any one got good instructions for this model for changing the isp?

The new ones are locked to Earthstation and are harder to crack. You'll need
to wait until the rom is dumped and the mailbug software is fully working.

I wasn't as lucky.  I went to office max last nite, and grabbed
a few of the $9.00 150's.  Just now, my curiosity got the better
of me, and I flashed the 0.0.2 mbug into one of them.

It seems that it flashed it ok, but when it rebooted, I got a
streak of bits written to the lcd (approx the top half inch of
the lcd).  That might indicate that the loader ran, and copied 
the mboot code to ram (it gets loaded into what normaly is the 
lcd buffer).  But it is not supposed to write the buffer to the 
lcd.  And it never turned on the "new mail" LED (one of the first
things mboot does when it starts running after being copied to ram.

Or, it could just be the cpu walking thru the screen ram.  The 
pattern does not seem to match the mboot code.

I stopped thinking about the idea of a "safer" image after your
success with 3.03a, but maybe I will have to get back to it.

Hmm... what version is in the 150? Mine is something like 4.x.

Anyway, I guess the good news is the reflash code is there, so at least
they can talk. Just need to remove the debugger's dependency on the boot
rom.

I gather there's no code in the ROM to dump the ROM out?

It was 4.somethin D, but it's kind of hard to tell now!  :-)
I have another that is 4.05D, so I imagine that first one was, too.

Right, it does seem to use the same reflash protocol.

I have been thinking about just how to organize the next version
of the mbug/mboot code.  (mboot is what I have been calling the
code that gets flashed into the ms codeflash, mbug is code that is 
loaded into ms RAM via laplink, and mailbug is what I am calling
the debugger that runs on the PC at the other end of the laplink.)

It seems it would be good to minimize the number of times you had
to risk losing access when flashing new code, but it would be nice
to be able to make changes, too.

The old code does this by loading the latest version into ram from
the PC host.  (Which also means you need the PC attached whenever
you reboot the mailstation.)

But eventually it would be nice to be able to run without the 
PC/laplink.

I am thinking that the next step might be a simple ROM monitor that
would let you run code at arbitrary locations in the codeflash, from
the ms keyboard, as well as connecting to the PC based debugger.

And to allow you to develop new versions of the monitor, and flash
them without the white knuckles, that it would be seperated into
two parts.  The first would go in page #00 and remain unchanged 
mostly.  It would be able to automatically jump into the second 
stage, which would be in a higher page that was eraseable separately
from the first stage.

Then, if (or should I say when!) you hosed that second stage with a 
careless change, you could hold a key on the ms keyboard while 
rebooting it.  That would make the first stage skip the auto-jump, 
and instead let you load mbug into ram, so you could fix the second 
stage with the debugger.

That's right.  At least a way has not been found yet, without
desoldering the chip, or doing other board surgery.

There is really no reason that the manufacturer would ever 
need to dump the rom, so the function is not there.

That makes it more dificult to interface to the existing code, but
not impossible.  I expect that before long we will be able to load
and run our own code in all except the 350's.  (Not that it would
be impossible, just that as far as I know, nobody is even working
on the 350.)

Yeah, most systems I've worked on have a boot sector/loader that almost
never changes. Comes up in bootloader, looks around a flash file system
for the application, loads it to RAM, checksums it, and if its OK, jumps
to it.

You have to add some kind of override... keyboard in our case, that
allows you to erase a bad application, so that you don't get into a bad
situation if the application is 'bad' even though the checksum is ok.

Yes a a simple standalone debugger would be nice. Another possibility is
to integrate this Forth interpreter: 

http://www.zetetics.com/camel/

Then high level code can be written on the MS itself, a simple Forth
assembler could be integrated, etc.

To adapt a Forth usually all you have to do is adapt KEY and EMIT to the
system so you do I/O. If we want to run the Forth directly from ROM
rather than RAM, we might be able to get some pointers from the Z88
CamelForth project since it can run directly from ROM.

Yeah a simple boot loader that can either find a second stage and
checksum it, or load and checksum an app directly to RAM if the second
stage either doesn't checksum or the user intervenes. I guess MBUG
qualifies as a loadable app, and mboot is the boot loader. Mailbug is
pretty much your typical target debugger. But if we can get Forth loaded
on there as the loaded app, I think it might be cool to develop new code
right on MS.

Yep. With the addition that we should probably checksum the second
stage.

The LCD says "Mailstation 120"; on the back "MIVO 200 DET2".

None of the keyboard tricks I'm reading about seem to work.

Pressing SHIFT+FUNCTION+T and powering on doesn't do anything.

Am I doing something wrong?

Is there a FAQ?

Is there a "better" (more hackable) model to look for?

Thanks.

-Dave

I'm a newb also and just bought this same MS120.  Mine
is blueish, and from what I've been reading these
unfortunately don't appear to be hackable.

The very best ones are the Mivo 100 with the Yahoo! function in the Menu.

See http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5767182298 - note the
Yahoo! second from the right.

Bummer.

Can these be used with mailbug?

Do *any* of the key sequences work?

FWIW, I ran back to the store and also nabbed an MS150 (Earthlink).  Seems to suffer 
the same problems.

Thanks.

I believe that Earthlink 'locked' them to prevent changing ISPs. Until we
can dump and/or alter the ROM we are stuck.

My guess is that the 150 will work with Mailbug, the remote debugger
soon (CJ has verified that it doesn't work yet, but the reflash protocol
is the same... that's good luck).

So once that is all working, you could conceivably load whatever
software you want on it including a hacked version of the software (or
an older rev might do what you need too).

Are you planning to use it just for email, or for something else?

Got one for the Dad and will go back for another for general hobby

We need someone who can dump the ROM - need a ROM burner/reader and the
right adaptor.

I think the MS would make the coolest little Forth machine, kind of a Jupiter Ace 2005.

I agree! I've made similar noises here but done nothing about it (too
many projects).

How about porting Z80 CamelForth to the ms?

I'm guessing it's one or two weekends of work, and then the MS is
stand-alone programmable, we could even put the editor and assembler in
ROM along with the Forth core.

Does CamelForth need a file system underneath it?

I don't think so.  Here's a good page:

http://www.hytherion.com/beattidp/comput/z80forth.htm

There's a reference to a Z180 port that is standalone.

No. The kernel gets flashed to ROM, then you interface with it over the
parallel port, (we'd need some kind of terminal program that talks over
parallel port on the DOS side) creating new definitions as you play.

In fact, traditionally Forth implements a "BLOCKS" wordset where
whatever storage you've got is divided into 64 X 16 blocks. So in a way,
classic Forth comes with its own file system approach that could be
used. I'm sure someone has done something to make a BLOCKS wordset that
works well with industrial flash chips (i.e. tries not to rewrite the
same blocks all the time).


Intro information on Forth:

http://home.iae.nl/users/mhx/sf.html
http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net (I helped to create the PDF)

(Note these cover older vintages of Forth, so many words are different,
but the core ideas are the same).

My hope is to turn it into a 'Super' Radio Shack Model 100 laptop. BTW,
looking on the Earthlink site it looks like they are not selling the Mivo
anymore. If they opened it up they could get more than $9 for them!

The thought has occurred to me... how are we going to do that without
battery backed RAM? I guess when we power down, we could write the RAM
image to flash. That's if the "power" button is pressed. But what if we
get a hard power failure... (no batteries, and DC adapter is pulled out,
or batteries die) I'm guessing there wouldn't be enough time to write it
out.

The ms RAM stays powered from the batteries when the power 
is switched off via the power button.  Would that be enough?

(It doesn't seem like too much of a hardship to keep batteries 
in it if you need battery-backed RAM!  :-)

Ah, didn't realize that. I figured it stored all files on flash, so why
would it battery back the RAM?

Anyway that's good news (to me).

Yes I suppose that's true. But the Model 100 has a nicad soldered to the
motherboard. It almost never gets used, spending most of its time fully
charged off either the battery or the wall cube. So if you leave an M100
on the shelf, the main batteries will die. But months later you turn the
thing on and all your files are still there!

Unlike say the Cambridge Z88, which doesn't have a battery backup but
just a capacitor similar to the way a Palm Pilot works. It's hard to get
the batteries changed in the short period of time you have from the
warning, especially if you're using rechargeables.

On an M100 you have a very long time before the memory will die even
with a warning and dead main batteries.

OK, if I unsolder the TSOP part (29F080?), can somebody read it out?  In the photos section 
there's a picture of an adaptor(?)

Thanks.

It takes considerable skill to desolder these without zapping them. But you
can read them while still in the unit.

The flash works well. I bought one on eBay - still had some of the owner's
files in it. I stored it for a few months with no power. Plugged it in and
the files are still there.

I have the MS120 (same one from Office Max for $9) and have success in unlocking it.

To do it:

1. Remove batteries - they must be out to do this!
2. Prepare AC adapter for use to power the mailstation.  You will need to be able to quickly and easily disconnect it..
3. press (and hold) [FUNCTION] [SHIFT] [D] and power on.  A menu should appear. 
4. Select *Restore Email Defaults" from the menu.  Press Enter. It will prompt "are you sure? YES / NO"
5. As soon as you press YES, you need to quickly interrupt the power to the unit-- corrupting the user account information in flash.
** Step #5 takes some tries-- dont give up, keep trying!
6. If you got it right, you can power up and select "NO Clear" (if a menu appears) and you should see "Press OK to configure a user account"
7. Once you press Enter, you will get to put in the login info (name/password, etc) ..

Sadly, you must go thru this to change it after, so let someone patient do it for you.. I have done it, and it works!

I tried at least a dozen times, it didn't work on my MS 120 which I bought last week at Office Max for $9.00. Thankfully I have a HP 648 printer at home so I can use it for a word processor which was the main reason I bought it BUT...I got sucked in by all the attempts to hack this little thing. What's most frustrating is to think there's probably an executive somewhere laughing his head off at us.

Attempts? It's already hacked. We just need to put something useful on
it...

I, too, couldn't pass up a $9.00 MS120. I bought it not to hack, but
to give to my Dad. My concern is that it can't handle HTML, which is
how nearly everyone sends stuff nowadays, even when they don't need
it. Are the HTML markups stripped, or does all the ugly HTML code show
up? If that's the case I won't spend the money to sign up for the serivce.

The service may strip the HTML but the machine won't. The service may be
rather expensive and I'm not sure how long it will be available. However a
lot of the USA doesn't have high speed access so for now ...

Well as a proof of concept I ported CamelForth to the Tandy WP-2, a
Z80 based word processor, not too different from the MS. I did the
WP-2 since I've been planning it for a while and it has a built in
serial-connected  disk driver that I happen to have a good emulator for.

I had to do a few things:

a) Use the Z180 port of CamelForth, since it can compile with the
Zilog assembler/linker. The original Z80 CamelForth is compatible with
some CP/M assembler.

b) Remove hardware specific stuff in the Z180 port. Nothing difficult,
just deleting some things.

c) Create a WP-2 compatible "header" for the file.

d) Implement EMIT, KEY, and KEY? EMIT outputs a character to the
terminal, KEY blocks reading a character from the terminal, and KEY?
just scans for the currently depressed key.

e) Use the HEX2BIN utility of sourceforge to convert Intel hex to binary.

f) Load it up and test my implementations of EMIT, KEY, and KEY?


Anyway, it works! The MS shouldn't be too different, at least if we
are using its routines. But for stand-alone (ie no dependence on Cidco
code) we'd need a little bit more, since we'd be generating characters
ourselves, and we'd have to do all the bootloader stuff. But it might
be easier to experiment with that kind of thing if we just get
CamelForth booting first, then we can play with all the hardware
interactively. I have some ideas for a simple flash file system if we
get tired of loading code at the keyboard or over the parallel port.

CamelForth is about 6K, there are instructions burning it to ROM
available (so it doesn't create any variables in program space). Or we
could just load and run it in RAM for now via MAILBUG.

-- John.

Hey, I'm new here so plese forgive the noobiness. I just got a hold of 
a det1 mailstation, and I've been looking around for ways to hack it 
so I can use my own isp with it. I have no idea what Im supposed to 
do, so any info would be super awsome.

Yes you can do this. But this question is answered once a week, so
please search the archive. Searching with the phrase "isp" or "my own
isp" should do it...

We really need to put a FAQ list...

Wooh, I was able to do it. My det1 succesfully logs into netzero. 
one problem though, when it tries to connect to the netzero mail 
server, it gets the error "the email service is busy or unavailable. 
please try again later." Same thing goes with my yahoo account. I'm 
pretty sure i put in the right pop3 and smtp adress. maybe its the 
fact that my email adress is .net, and the pop3 and smtp adresses 
are .com, though i dont think that's it.  hmm... do you guys know of 
any free email places that work well with it?
Oh and is the yahoo option functional at all? all i get is a clear 
screen.

AFAIK they dumped the service after a year. I bought a used machine with two
of the messages still inside - neat! I'd like to figure it out and 'fix' it
to work again.

Does the z180 code run on a z80?  If it does, what makes it a z180 
port?
Just curious.

Did you use existing terminal routines in the WP-2?

So far, all I have found in ms is the raw scancode key buffer 
routines.
Won't be "too hard" (heh, there I go again) to convert to ascii.

On the output side it might be a little more work.  I have some
quick and dirty code that writes whole strings to LCD.  I used
the existing message display function from the update code.
Its easy to set the line it writes on, but it always wants to write
starting at the left edge of the screen.  

Probably the most straight forward way to do a better 
terminal would be to restore the font page in codeflash,
and then use the LCD code in page #00 of the codeflash.  
But I don't know if there is a "text mode" cursor.  Might 
have to keep track of that ourselves.

Mailbug can load intel .hex files!  :-)

Yeah, it seems like you would need to store your program files
somewhere, even if the forth interpreter is in rom.  And a text
editor to write programs, or is that part of forth already?

I got a couple recently that have a "MyCIDCO" icon on the main
menu.  This must be a replacement for the "My Yahoo" function.

One has TV listings & weather for Jan 6, 2005.  The other
had news, and something else, also from this year (I guess I
erased it with the "flash test").  So, it would seem that 
Earthlink was still providing it in January.

The info is stored in the first 8 pages of the dataflash, one page
for each item in the sub-menu under mycidco.  I just get a blank
page now on the one I erased, with a "mycidco" tab at the top.
But there used to be two icons on that page, and selecting one
would display a page of data.  The data for the page is stored
as one big bitmap graphic.

I don't think there is a lot of hope of using it as intended, 
without a mailstation account from Earthlink.  Even if you could 
get the data into those pages (I suspect it uses the "clipmail" 
extensions to pop protocol), where would you get the data to load?

But it might be a way to add some new functions to the
ms menu.  It doesn't have to be tv listing or news, it
can be any code you want.  I spliced some code into the 
eventhadler, and it runs whenever you select the icon, or
any key is pressed, while viewing the associated data page.  
(I just made it blink the mail LED.)

It probably won't look very good after yahoo smashes all the 
indenting out, but here is the format of each item/page:

(try view source if reading this on website)

4000  C3 00 78       JP eventhandler

I haven't seen anything special. The only thing about this port that I
needed was that it assembles with the Zilog assembler/linker instead of
some CP/M assembler/linker. Seems to run fine on a regular Z80 chip.

Yes. And of course now I'm finding that the charout is buggy on some
WP-2 ROMs when you get to the screen scroll. So I may have to do it
myself at least for the last character on screen.

Yeah that sounds like not a big deal. Are they even encoded? In the
WP-2, for example, they are two bytes, one that has the ascii code and
the other has bits set for various shift and function keys.

Fixed width fonts aren't hard to make in any event. Better to use
something without the Cidco copyright on it.

At the momemnt cursor doesn't work all that well on WP-2, but I can get
along ok without it. Will add one soon, just not my top priority.

I'd like a new version :-) That's one of the reasons I've been poking
around with WP-2 instead of MS, I know you said there are some bugs in
the released code.

Good point on the editor... then WP-2 is a word processor in ROM so I
get an editor for free. On the MS, once we get Forth loaded there are
lots of block editors around, and I believe there are also full screen
editors. I've seen at least one complete forth word processor source
code, we could use that if can't find something smaller.

In any event we could just redirect I/O to the parallel port and
interact completely over a terminal session. Then to upload code just
use the terminal program. Then we could bootstrap our way to a
filesystem.

Yes. See "Cracking" in the files section of the mailstation Yahoo group

There is no web browser built-in to the mailstation, just a mail client.
Maybe eventually we'll be able to do text mode browsing.

As far as changing the ROM, this feature is just for developers right
now. So if you want to write experimental programs for the DET-1 in
assembly language, this can be useful and the tools are in the Files
section (Mailbug), However, there's nothing significant for end users to
load on the MS yet, hopefully soon though.

I think it is just [FUNCTION] [D] and [power on]
for the 150 & 120.  You should get a menu, with
"reset default acct" as an option.

Poking the reset button might be a lot easier than
pulling the power (and might even work with batteies in).

After picking "reset default acct", you answer Y, and almost
immediately poke reset (or yank power cord).  The trick is 
to let it run just long enough to erase the old acct, but
not long enough to finish re-writing the default acct info.  

IIRC, it is only a fraction of a second between the "yes" 
and when it writes the default account info, so the 
"sweet spot" that you need to catch it at is *very* short.  
You will likely need to try many times.

Every possible key combination that I have found posted has been tried with my 120 which uses version 4.04E. On the back of this BLUE machine it indicates it is a MIVO 200 DET2. All I want to do is change the email settings. Later.

Revise that to:

[FUNCTION] [D] and [plug in power cord]

*or*

[FUNCTION] [D] and [press reset]

The power button will not work (like it does to put 
older models in test mode).

When I said that last Saturday, I thought it was ready...
Then, before uploading, I thought I might actually test
it!  The new flash code was working "pretty good", but
when flashing large blocks, it would sometimes get a 
timeout error.  This was quite puzzling, because until then,
the laplink code had been working flawlessly.

It took me quite a while to figure out just *what* was happening, 
and then even longer to understand *why*.  I'm pretty sure I
have it fixed now.  I will do some more testing tonight,
and if all goes well, I'll upload it.

(This is just a fix to ver 0.0.2, not the "next version", so
it is still just for the older models.)

If I want to hack it, that is.  My Office Max has a pile of both so,
after comparing appearance (identical), features (identical), and

and a higher model number.  It's going off to Mom, anyway, if it
passes the ease of use and setup tests (ie: my brother can set it up,
a critical test since this is the guys who has caused Mom to not be on

a new one), but I want one for my own self to, you know, PLAY with.

I searched this forum and found few clues to the difference beyond
suspicions that it is in the software.  Is one model better for
hacking than the other?

So what are the changes to the new rev? Bugfixes only?

In any event that should allow me to get CamelForth going. Might have to
render characters myself, but that isn't too hard.

I have a 150 and a DET-1. The 150 can probably be loaded with new
software througn reflash on the parallel port since it uses the same
protocol as the older units. Unfortunately there's nothing safe to flash
to the 150 just yet. For the DET-1 there is though. Same goes for the
120 from what I understand.  The problem at the moment isn't really the
model # on the unit, it's the version of firmware that's installed on
it. Some things have moved around in newer versions relative to where
mboot expects things to be.

Soon hopefully.

-- John.

"load", "save" and "verify" should all work properly now.  They
each had the same problem with address calculations.  (Apparently,
when I modified them to use 32 bit address, I didn't really test
the change.)  Load only loads into RAM, but save should be able to
save the protected pages of the codeflash to disk.

Codeflash erase and write ("erase" & "zap") are working fine
now, too.  Writing codeflash is quite a bit slower now, due
to the fact that flash algorithm runs on the PC now, not on
the mailstation.  It takes 35 seconds to flash a 16k page,
versus 4.2 seconds with older method.  I have another method
in mind that would be much faster. (maybe in future revision???)

After I figured out what was wrong with old method (using code
in same rom you are writing is not allowed), I was gonna add
flash erase and flash write commands into mbug.  Then I realized
that the flash algorithm could be implemented on either side of
the laplink cable.  So I moved it over to the mailbug side.  It
is slower now, because the flash commands have to be sent to the
codeflash for each byte over the laplink.

Most (all???) of the commands now can be cancelled with esc key.

Several minor changes, that I can't think of right now.

There is a new .zip file with (hopefully) all the files
you need.  You need at a minimum the new mailbug.exe, and
the matching mbug.rom.  They should work fine with the old
mboot.rom if you already flashed it.  You should be able to
unzip it on top of the old files.  I added scancode.hex, and
a newer version of hello.rom.  The "crunch.dat" file may be
newer, too (not sure).  crunch.dat holds the type info for
the disassembler.

I started making up some instructions for how to use it,
but I haven't got very far with it yet.  If anyone has
questions, just ask.

Oh, yeah, I added a "blank check" for codeflash, but forgot
to add it to the menu.  It's ctrl-b and it will prompt for 
which pages to check.

Could somebody say what mailbug works with now amongst the various MSxx0, DETx, 
and firmware models?  What models may work in the future?  What models might never 
work?

Thanks.

Of course it can, but besides being slow as you've found, it is probably
not the safest way to do it. If the connection breaks during burn (more
likely since it takes longer) you could end up, say, with a
half-programmed boot block.  Or is this code intended only for burning
outside of the boot block?

Probably the best thing would be to a) download a checksummed chunk of
manageable size b) checksum it c) if it matches, burn it in.

Actually flash block burns should probably not be interruptible.

The old brown non ergonomic case models, 
firmware ver 2.22r, 2.53yr, 2.54. 
These old models before the mailstation/mivo 100
did not have a "number".  Possibly some of the
mailstation/mivo 100 with firmware 3.xx???
I think John H. flashed one of those and it
worked.

> What models may work in the future?  

I expect that sooner or later, all up to 250.
They are all quite similar.

> What models might never work?

350.  It has different cpu (not z80).  
AFAIK, nobody is working on it.
Esentially would be a different project
from this one.

At this point, it is known that the current mboot.rom
does *not* work with the NEW 150's.  I expect it also
does not work with the old 150's, or the 120 (old & new)
or the 200 or 250.  And if it doesn't work, and you flash
it anyhow, you will need a soldering iron and a prom 
programmer to fix it.  I expect that the flood of
these models from Officemax will mean a new version
sometime in the near (???) future, that works with the
120 & 150 (I bought a pile of them myself.)

For now, it works with the real-old brown non-ergonomic case
models, in particular firmware versions 2.22r, 2.53yr,
and 2.54.  I think also one of the 3.somethin' models
is known to work.  I would only use it with one of
the firmware versions known to work, and wait for
a new mboot.rom for any un-tried firmware versions.

Now, maybe you are wondering what I mean, "old & new"?
Well, I opened up a few of them, and there are at least
two different circuit boards in both the 120 & 150.

The major difference I can see is that the newer 120/150's
have a different LCD.  It has a distinctly blue tint to it
(the dark pixels), where the older one was black.  And it
is not just the color, it has fewer conductors in it's cable.

The cpu/ram/codeflash/dataflash looks to be the same in
all that I have opened.  The modem circuitry is definitely
different from old to new.

The old 120 & old 150 use identical hardware, as far as 
I can tell.

The new 120 & new 150 are also identical (almost), but diferent 
from the older.  

The only differnce I can see between the new 120 & the 
new 150, is the part# on the main PCB, and where the 
Underwriters Lab logo is placed.

And of course, the firmware is different in all four.

From my small sample, it appears that the old 120's are in the
thinner boxes (approx 2.5" thick), the case is violet 
(or purple???), and they say "MIVO 200 CIDCO MODEL DET2"
on the bottom of case.  Box sez "DET1E", same as new 120 box.
(I think they reflashed mivo 200's, and called 
them "mailstation 120".)  Black LCD.

The new 120's are in the bigger box (approx 5" thick),
and the case is dark grey (top is same color as the 
bottom), and it says "MAILSTATION 120 EARTHLINK MODEL DET1E"
on bottom.  And they have the new blue LCD.

I only have one "old 150", and I think it was in a thin box
(this is the one I got fall 2003, free after rebate at officemax).
Black LCD, says "MIVO 150 CIDCO MODEL DET1B" on bottom.
(hardware essentially the same as Mivo 200 or the old 120.)

All the 150's I saw at officemax this month were in big boxes, 
and the couple I opened were "new" models, with blue LCD.
On bottom: "MAILSTATION 150 EARTHLINK MODEL DET1D".
 
> I searched this forum and found few clues to the difference beyond
> suspicions that it is in the software.  Is one model better for

Bottom line is that there are only slight differences in
the hardware between *any* of the models up to 200.
It's just a matter of finding time to get around to the 
newer models.  If you want to start playing today, you
should use one of the oldest models.

That is a very good point, that I had not considered.  

The first reason I thought of for doing it this way was to remove 
the possibility of accidently erasing/flashing, which was a problem
in the past.  :-)

The second reason was that it was way easier to code it in Pascal
than z80 assembler!  ;^)

> Or is this code intended only for burning
> outside of the boot block?

Right up until the last moment, I had locked out the ability to erase
the boot blocks.  I wanted to add a special function that would
erase and reflash the boot code all in one operation.  But I 
compromised
in the spirit of just getting it uploaded.  So now it issues a 
"stern warning" if you ask it to erase boot code.  You can only
continue by typing "I dont't care" at the prompt.  :^O

> Probably the best thing would be to a) download a checksummed chunk 
> of manageable size b) checksum it c) if it matches, burn it in.

Sounds reasonable to me.  Maybe even send a whole 16k page, in
the case of the boot block, and then let it burn it all at once.

> > Most (all???) of the commands now can be cancelled with esc key.
> 
> Actually flash block burns should probably not be interruptible.

They're not, at least after you let it start.  But if you hit the 
key for, say, erase (or load, or save, etc.), when it is asking you 
*what* to erase (load, save ,etc.), you can just skip it.  

I do want to add the ability to abort some commands without 
finishing (for instance blank checking all 64 codeflash pages 
can get tiresome).  But reflashing of the boot block
would definitely be one you would not want to be 
interruptable.

> Can it be used to update existing mbug.rom?

(I know you mean mboot.rom, I can't keep them straight myself,
and I named them!)

Yes.  But you will have to answer the warning with
"I don't care" (including the ' in don't) to erase the old
mboot.rom, and then flash the new - _without_rebooting_mbug!

But the neat thing about it is you should seldom need to
reflash a new mboot.rom.  That is why it is seperated into
mbug and mboot.  Mbug is a file on the PC disk, that gets
loaded over the laplink to mailstation RAM.  It is what
the debugger (mailbug) uses to interface to mailstation.

It is a trivial matter to make change to mbug, reassemble,
and test.  If you made a mistake, no problem, it's just
in RAM.  Edit, assemble, and try again.

Mboot is the part that is flashed into mailstation.
It's only job is to run when mailstation reboots,
and load the current mbug into ram.

We need a better mboot.rom for the 120/150 etc.

Eventually, I want to split the code that runs on 
the mailstation into three parts:
1) Seldom changing boot code (mboot.rom), either loads mbug, 
   or executes rom monitor if not connected to PC (mailbug).
2) Changeable-without-fear-of-hosing rom-monitor, that 
   runs automatically when not connected to mailbug.
3) Latest greatest interface to debugger (mbug.rom, but 
   it is not really burned to rom)  

If this doesn't make any sense, it is probably due to the fact
that I have been up since yesterday.  I really need to
sleep now...

Most of my settings are y'd out.  It's a funky y with two dots on top, just above the 
raised arms.  so far my reply to address has that, but the primary dns is blank.  other 
settings appear normal.   
 
auto check mail is no  
auto check time is at 2 am 
call waiting is no  
ignore dial tone is no  
and speaker is yes  
  
My 120 wasn't hackable via any other means.  I decided to yank power 
just after hitting  
'save' settings. hehe oops.  It's not resetting to factory defaults 
now.  I guess I toasted it  
:)  
  
any idea if there's a jtag testing point on these buggers?  Also, 
what GNU/GPL tools can  
be used with this?  I've used the avr micro compiler to build 
firmware for atmels before.  
(c code to intel hex files).  
  
Thanks.

I'd suggest using mailbug. With it you can reflash the unit over the
serial port with whatever you want.

You could just use mailbug or burn NoICE in there.

sdcc comes to mind. Probably others. More public domain or freeware
stuff than gpl...

The 120s my Officemax has are in a shallower box while the 150s are in 
a deeper box.  By all appearances, I cannot begin "playing" today, 
whichever I buy for myself, but more people appear to have 120s so I'm 
assuming that will be the first to get the new mboot.rom.  Therefore, 
since there doesn't appear to be any compelling reason to buy a 150, on 
my way home from work I will buy a couple shallow-box 120s, one for 
playing and one for family email since my wife objects to anybody in 
the house actually using any of our computers ("You just waste time!").

Isn't that the purpose of computers?

BTW, it is possible to reprogram the MailStation at least in part by email,
so if we could figure out that trick ..... !

I've been working on a new mboot for the unknown
firmware mailstations today, and I just flashed 
the first version of "safeboot.rom" into a 150 v4.05D.

I have control of the 150 now, and can load code
and execute it.  I can't display anything on the LCD,
but I expected there to be some differences, since it
is a different display that the older ones had.

I loaded my scancode.hex program, and it blinks the
mail LED when I press keys.  :-)

I haven't really studied it yet, but large parts of
the page #00 rom code look identical to the older models.
The code in the LCD routine area is definitely different.

I have to quit for now, but I might get back to this later
tonight.  I want to test it on some other models, and
maybe make some changes, but I don't expect it will be
long before I can upload a new version.

Okay, I guess I'll buy two 150s on my way home.  I'm nothing if not 
adaptable!  :-)

Thanks, Cyrano!  I appreciate you doing this work so I don't have to 
learn how to do it myself.

Awesome :-)

Given that you're going to be inundated with folks buying 120's and
150's this is a big step!

Ok, I lied.  I'm still messing with it.  My curiosity
once again won, and I flashed the clunky first version
into a violet/purple 120 (old) v4.04E.  It works!!!  
And the LCD works same as in old brown model.  :-)

I also flashed a dark grey 120 (new) v4.05E, and it works 
similar to the "new" 150.  No display yet.

Now where is that 250, I know I left it around 
here somewhere....
Maybe later.

In case anyone just got here, don't flash the mboot.rom
from mailbug ver 0.0.2a into any of the 120/150/250 models, 
it will not work.

And to prevent any misunderstanding, there is NO software
to flash yet, just the debugger.  And for the time being,
any new software will likely be programmed in z80 assembler.

Gosh, I don't really know which to advise right now.  I expect
both will work fine soon, but for now the "new" LCD requires some
additional work before we can use it.  But the newer one might look
better???  Or at least it looks bluer!

did it, reset, started smoking... it started shaking.. and a picture
of Bill Gates came on the screen....  It said "I'm sorry this is not
an approved Microsoft product"...


ok back to reality...

I think the keybaord is perfect for applications, ta heck with hacking
it.  has anyone figured out the internal cable coordination so this
might be used for somethign else?  This is just perfect.

I have the MS120 and 15 from Officemax.  It really woudl be nice to
short this and c9orrect the memory so its forced to reset... anyone
think abotu that?

enjoy.

Nitch.

I followed the instructions that were posted in the file on April 23,
2005.

The TOP of the file said :
<QUOTE>
If you press Function + d (on the MS 150, V4.04D) and press the
hard reset button (with a paper clip) you'll get a slightly different
menu dialog (the "Reset System Data" menu) after the memory scan? You
have to keep holding Function + d after the reboot to see it.
The menu shows an additional item: "Restore Default Account".
</QUOTE>


DO IT!!!

Be quick when selecting YES and WHAM!  it works!

Got ALL of the network settings to reset also !!!   I can NOW use it
with my ISP.

Fantastic!!!

THANK YOU !!!!!

Enjoy!!

Just bought one of the infamous $9.00 MS120s; had gotten as far as 
identifying the chips involved when I found this group and 
discovered that a lot of my work had been done for me. Anybody got 
any input on the idea of using the MS120 as a serial console for 
headless Linux machines? Does the CXNT modem chip need rs232 inputs? 
There has to be VT100 code for Z80s out there somewhere. It would be 
a STUNNINGLY useful piece of equipment in that role... 
 
Any ideas? 
 
Steve

I think CJ has done some stuff with bit banging a serial port=
 using
the parallel port. But you'll need to add a level converter at least=
.

Also for cheap slabtops that make good terminals out-of-the-box
there's =
the Tandy WP-2, the Tandy 10x, Tandy 200, the Amstrad NC100,
or the Cambrid=
ge Z88 (with the serial port rewired to standard
ideally).

Now that I have blank fields, I've been looking for a email service. Any suggestions? Thanks. And keep it as simple and stupid as possible...as I've read the various posts I see there are people in this group WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more advanced than I on this whole thing. As I've tried to do the research myself I can't figure out which email services will work and which won't. I think I'm smart enough to know that the 'web based' ones won't. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

You need a dial up service which offers POP/SMTP mail. Juno/NetZero offers
"Free Internet Access and Email" for 10 hours each month however it may be
that this system won't work except on a PC.

If you only use it for a MailStation this should be plenty since you'll run
about 3 minutes per day.

Others are

Just search for (free dial up email)

Now that I have blank fields, I've been looking for a email service. Any
suggestions? Thanks. And keep it as simple and stupid as possible...as I've
read the various posts I see there are people in this group
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more advanced than I on this whole thing. As I've tried
to do the research myself I can't figure out which email services will work
and which won't. I think I'm smart enough to know that the 'web based' ones
won't. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello,

I have a blue Mailstation 150 that I picked up at Office Max for $9. 
Last night I tried the "Ctrl + D, reset button & power off" method of
modifying the ISP info and it works great.  Thanks to all of you for
your effort and for sharing your results with us!

Initially I was hoping to use the Mailstation to monitor my incoming
email (from the kitchen or wherever.)  But then I realized that the
Mailstation most likely will delete messages from the email server
after retrieving them.  That's not good - I want all my messages on my
main computer, and I don't want to lose any photos people might send.

So now I'm thinking of other ways I can use it:

- to send quick text messages without using my main computer
- to write/send memos to myself
- I can use it pretty much anywhere since it's so portable
- for spare parts

What about everyone else?  Have you discovered any handy uses for your
Mailstation?

Thanks!
Jeff

I believe that's an option you can set.

Hoping to use it as a cheaper/faster/cheesier Model 100 programmable in
Forth or C. I have a start on a Forth, but more work to do still.

I use vintage laptops everyday, the mailstation is probably faster and
has more storage space than any of them.

So, do you just do the magic settings shown with the multi-key
Mailstation setup, pay your $4.95 and sign in? I already have service
in my home town, but I'm considering buying the $4.95 service you
mention for my computer-illiterate cousin in San Angelo out in west
Texas and my
completely technophobic mother in Austin. I see both places have
numbers, as does my current place of domicile in Ganado. This service
looks cool, if that's all there is to it.

Can either of the two then advance to 'normal' 56k access with a PC on
the same service/price?

Thanks in advance,
Rick

THanks for the input re services that are available. I found another one, <agapeinternet.com> . They picture a MailStation on one of their pages and I emailed them with some questions and they responded within 24 hours. They appear to have a LOT of dialup numbers. I've used mine as a word processor that I'm not afraid to toss into the corner or fall off the back seat or get bumped off the table onto the floor. They seem pretty durable.

Hi Neil,

If you find this option could you let me know?  I looked through all
of the Mailstation 150 menus and couldn't find it.  

Thanks!

I see lots of stuff on this list for 100, 120, etc. But my local
(Victoria TX) store has the MS200/DET2 machines (which strangely come
up with the screen saying it is a "MailStation 120"). I have 4
reserved **IF** I can change the email data. I've been trying this
morning to use the
Function-D
Push in the reset with a toothpick
Pull out the power

I do see a different menu, but now what?

Normal reset menu:
Heading: Reset System Data
then
No Clear
Clear E-Mail Data
Clear Address Book Data
Clear All Data

When I do the Function-D dance shown above, I get a menu that is:
Heading: Reset System Data
then
Restore Default Account
Clear E-Mail Data
Clear Address Book Data
Clear All Data

Now what?
I can NEVER get it to come up with a set of input solicitations that
ask me for the email info I really need to push into the machine.

Another query:
What if I fix this one and send it to a computer illiterate cousin or
my ditto mother? Will the info hold? Or will I require them to mail it
back every time the batteries go flat? How often must the complicated
maneuver be repeated in 'normal' use?

I know that is really more than one query, but I'm holding off on a
60-mile round trip pending the answers.

Hayelp, pliz.

Choose "Restore Default Account" and "Yes".  The instructions said to 
press Enter and immediately pull the plug, but I found that it works if 
you press Enter and reset.

I'm not sure, maybe someone else knows.  Try taking the batteries out 
and letting it sit for a few days.

It all about the timing. You have to get it just right
when you try to corrupt the flash memory. You got to
do it right after it delete the old data and before it
write new data back to the flash memory.  You may have
to try 10 ... 20 time. Good luck,

I have a black 120 v4.0SE

I have it configured with my POP3 yahoo account.  Changing the 
settings took me a couple of minutes using the great advice from here, 
but I can't send email.  I keep getting a message saying that the 
server is busy and to try again later.  But I can wait and wait but 
still get the same message.  All of my information is correct 
including the SMTP.  Does anyone know of any issues that exist with 
yahoo.  I have a premier yahoo account and have enabled POP3.  Doesn't 
make sense that I can receive and not send.

I have posted scans of what you see when you receive the Yahoo special

out how these messages were formatted one day?

From what I understood it wasnt exactly dumped, just
not supported. (they would set you up, but if you
didnt get them oh well). I do belive that it comes as
some sort of attachment to an e-mail. If you know
someone who gets them, go to their earthlink webmail
and you should be able to view the source of the
e-mail.

I dont have any samples, just saw it once :(

Cool, I was wondering what the yahoo data looked like.
I have several ms's with the yahoo feature, but none with
any data saved.

I do have one with the MyCidco feature, and data for tv &
weather, and it looks almost identical, (where yours
says "yahoo", mine says "mycidco").  The format for the data
screens looks the same.  It seems a sure bet now that
they really are the same feature (and underlying
mechanisms are same).  Oh yeah, the date of the info
saved in mine is Jan 6, 2005.

If anybody here has an account with these features active,
it would be great if you could capture one of the "clipmail"
messages (I am assuming that is how data is sent), and post 
it here.

The big question is whether they use the "security key"
with this data.

The data for the mycidco tv & weather is stored in the
first two pages of the dataflash, and it's stored as
*executable* code.  

That means if we figure out how to load tv listings,
we know how to execute arbitrary code.

See Message 282 for everything I know about the format 
of the mycidco data in the dataflash.
If you hit the reply button while viewing msg 282,
the column formating will be fixed in the reply window.

I have uploaded mailbug Version 0.0.3, and it
works with the new LCD in the latest models.
I have not tried it on the older models, but
I expect it works with them too.  I actually have
only installed the current "sboot.rom" on one
unit, a "new" 120 with ver 4.05e firmware.

If anyone installs it, please post to list
what model/firmware version of mailstation, and 
if there was any problem (I don't expect any).

I still have not seen the code inside of the 200 or 250,
but I am going on the assumption that it is similar enough
that sboot.rom will work with them, but you never know.

I would suggest that if wrecking a mailstation
would ruin your whole day (or make you want to
sue someone), that you probably should not be
flashing *anything* into it.

I am uploading as separate files this time, mainly
so I can upload the part that is ready, and the 
rest later.

I have a draft of a user manual almost ready, but I 
haven't uploaded it yet.

OK, I uploaded a first draft.  

Files > Mailbug > mailbug_0.0.3 > Mailbug_User_Guide.doc
is probably easier to read, if the proportional font
is part of the doc format????

There is a plain text version too, but the fixed font
skews some of the text.

Let me know what I forgot, or anything that needs

Well, I've got another 120/4.05e that's now displaying "Welcome to
Mbug!" and cheerfully ignoring the power button, so I guess I can
report it works on the platform you already know it works on. Seems
like Mailbug has a tendency to just lock up whenever anything unusual
happens, though. The first time I tried reading the SN I had the lpt
port disabled in the BIOS, and Mailbug hung with a timeout error.
Second time was actually after it finished sboot.rom. That locked it
with no message of any kind.

Now I just need to figure out how to get my own code on the thing. If
I understand things correctly, I need to:
* Create a new project by copying the mbug directory
* Use as80 to assemble my .rom
* Set the (w)orkfile and (l)oad it into RAM
* (g)oto the address where I loaded the .rom

Am I missing anything? And would you mind pointing out any good things
to avoid doing while I figure out how everything works?

This looks like it'll be fun. Thanks for getting this working with the
newer firmware.

Great!

I'd actually be happy to hear from anyone who uses it,
whichever mailstation they are using, known to work already, or not.

Speaking of having the port enabled, I tried (under win 98)
disabling the win 98 LPT1 driver, thinking the direct port
access might conflict.  It didn't work at all.  Apparently
win 98 is trapping the port writes, and using it's driver
to do the actual i/o.  You need the driver in win 98 too
(but only if you are running under win98, of course.  Driver is
probably already enabled if you have a parallel port.)

There are a number of things that will get you caught in
timeout hell.  This is an area that I know needs work.
I am aware that new users will probably stumble into it,
where I manage too avoid it, just because I know these
roads a little better.

A real old joke comes to mind,
 patient: "Doctor, it hurts when I do *this*"
  doctor: "don't do *that*!"
(that'll be a $100)

I don't know if I can detect that the port is not enabled,
but I will take a look at what happens after writing sboot.rom,
and see if I can see the hangup.  I know that in the very first
version of sboot, there definitely was a problem there, but I 
thought it was fixed.  But, I have only gone through the
whole procedure once with current sboot.

It probably is a good idea to use the "reboot" command 
(3 on pc keyboard) after writing sboot.rom (after leaving 
the "update mode").  Which brings up a question, do you
remember if you ever got a prompt back after sboot was
done flashing?  

Also, do you remember if the mail LED on mailstation
was lit after flashing sboot?  The mail LED will be lit
whenever sboot is waiting for a command, and off after
sboot exec's mbug. 

The problem might be that the flash code is waiting
for the *mailstation* code to reboot (and we erased it,
and sboot is what we should look for after the flash).

I probably should change it so you are bounced out of the
update mode automatically after flashing sboot, because
*nothing* in the update mode menu will work after you've
erased the original mailstaion code.

After sboot is flashed, the bootup sequence should go
like this:

1)After any reboot (pc keybd, ms reset button, or jp #0000) 
  sboot waits for a command, with LED on.

Then, if you give mailbug a command that requires mbug be 
running, mailbug will load mbug into ms RAM, and then 
execute it.  (keyboard command "4" will explicitly load mbug).
This is accomplished with a sequence of commands to sboot:

2)Mailbug issues a "load" command to sboot, which sboot
  executes, with LED off.  

3)After receiving the first block of mbug code, and writing 
  it to ms RAM, sboot waits for another command with LED on.

4)Mailbug issues another "load" command to sboot, which sboot
  executes, with LED off.  For no real good reason, the load
  is done 1024 bytes per command, so it takes two loads to
  send the entire mbug. 

5)After receiving the second block of mbug code, and
  writing it to ms RAM, sboot waits for another command 
  with LED on.

6)Mailbug issues an "exec" command, which sboot executes,
  with LED off.

7)Previous command put mbug in control, so LED stays off.
  From sboot's perspective, command never finished, but 
  that's ok, mailbug expects mbug to be in control now.
  Any further commands will be handled by mbug.

The three commands happen so fast you will not see the 
LED flicker, it looks like LED just turns off.  
You can think of the LED as saying "welcome to sboot",
as opposed to mbug's "welcome to mbug" message that is
displayed on the LCD.

Sboot only knows how to "load" and "exec".  

Mbug not only knows "load" & "exec", but also "unload", 
"iopoke", "iopeek", and a few more (like the breakpoint 
commands that will work again one day, I promise).

> Now I just need to figure out how to get my own code on 
> the thing. If I understand things correctly, I need to:

This is an area open to personal tastes.  You can
put your files anywhere you want.  The "project"
directory sets the default path, and also sets
where the disassembler will look for comment files, 
and where dump files will be written.  You can put
all your programs in one project if you want, and
you can even put them in the same project as your 
firmware files (assuming you even have the firmware 
files).

You don't *need* any of the files from mbug directory in
your project dir, but you might want to copy the 
assembler there, just so it's easy to find.  I really
hate ever setting something like that in the "path"
environment variable.  So I either copy as80 to the
project dir, or use the path in any command invoking it. 

> * Use as80 to assemble my .rom
> * Set the (w)orkfile and (l)oad it into RAM
> * (g)oto the address where I loaded the .rom

That's right. 

4000 would be a good place to org your asm files.  

Then, assuming slot4000 was holding the RAM page you want, 
(I suggest ram pg #01,) l4000 followed by g4000.  

Ram pg #01 will be in slot4000 when mbug starts.
If you don't do anything that changes it, you can use
"4000" as the address.  If you are not sure what is in
slot4000, then use "1014000" (shorter way of saying "0101:4000")

Hmmmm....
Erasing the bootcode would be something to avoid. :-)
Other than that, nothing comes to mind.  Any questions
are welcomed.

It's DOS, but there were two different mechanisms to disable the 
parallel port in the BIOS. One's a hardware setting, and the other a 
security option. I had the latter set for a while and didn't notice. 
I wonder if in that case the lpt port looks like it's there and is 
just inaccessable. Tonight I'll see if I get different results if the 
hardware itself is disabled.

Actually, I tried this specificly because the manual said it wouldn't 
work. I figured reading the serial number would be a reasonably safe 
way to determine mailbug's failure mode.

Would it be any easier to just make the procedure more feedbackey? I 
couldn't really tell whether mailbug was actually hung, or stuck in a 
loop waiting for something that would never happen, or just on the 
fourth of five attempts of an operation with a fairly long timeout.

When it finished writing it stayed in update mode, so I tried reading 
the SN again and had to reboot. I pulled the power to the mailstation 
at the same time, but in retrospect I should have tried communicating 
with it once mailbug was back up to see whether the software got into 
an unworkable state there, or if the problem was contained to the PC.

It looked like the mailstation did reboot after the update. The 
display went blank, at any rate. I'm pretty sure the mail LED lit up, 
but I can't remember now whether that was after the update or after I 
power-cycled.

It also might be helpful to automatically do something benign that 
would demonstrate that mailbug is still able to communicate with the 
mailstation now that sboot's in control. After the mailstation 
reboots, could mailbug (v)erify sboot automatically?

I assume I'll at least need mbug.rom if I want to use anything that 
requires it to be loaded. Or will mailbug find it even if I'm not 
using the default project?

Okay, here's my initial list of things mailbug doesn't like very much.

On an unflashed Mailstation, get (S)erial number produced the
following error when I had the cable unplugged, when I had the lpt
hardware disabled, and when I had the lpt port locked using the
security features of the BIOS.

   sendtribble: timeout waiting for ms to drop busy. (1)

Pressing Esc recovered. Seems I neglected to try that when I was
messing around yesterday.

On the Mailstation that's running sboot, (S) produced a similar error
and the email LED shut off. Esc still recovered, and I could r(3)boot
from the main menu.

   sendtribble: timeout waiting for ms to send. (6)
   mailstation did not ACK the dataflash command

(S) with mbug loaded was slightly more fun. I got the same error as
when I tried it against sboot, and Esc still recovered, but when I
tried to r(3)boot I got this:

   Hmmmm... The mailstation's "busy" signal is stuck high.
     That often means the laplink cable is not connected
     or that the mailstation is not powered
   receivetribble: timeout waiting for ms to strobe. 2 (3)
   receivetribble: timeout waiting for ms to strobe. 3 (3)
   getack2 sees the bail flag, and exits(false) while waiting for: $
   *** Soft reset failed ***
   Hit mailstation reset button now. (or hit key to skip)

Power-cycling the mailstation and lo(4)ding mbug recovered.

I'll let you know if I manage to break it in a more interesting way.

I guess the manual was right!  :-)

The reason it doesn't work, is that mailbug's serial number read
function is interacting with the stock mailstation's serial
number read function.  After you reflash, it is no longer
a mailstation.  Some of the low level mailstation code is still
there, even the code that does the serial number read is still
there.  But it is no longer active, because the event loop that 
waits for the update commands is *gone*.

I'll see what I can do to make it more obvious what's happening.

Most of the time, mailbug will timeout anytime it waits
more than about a second.  And any timeout will display
an error message.  There are a few cases where
it is normal to wait more than a second, and if it is
waiting one of those places, it could look hung.
(Waiting for a command to complete in "update mode" is 
one of those places.)  

I think that all of those "long waits" can be aborted by just 
hitting <esc> key.  But, you don't get a message to that effect,
something I need to fix.

Ok, I just tried it.  There is a message on the screen:
 These functions require the original mailstation code be running,
 and a parallel laplink cable between the pc and the mailstation.
 This likely will not work anymore after you reflash, since
 the original mailstation code is erased when reflashing.

but maybe it has scrolled off the top after you reflash?

Just for kicks, I ignored message, and hit <s> (serial
num read).  The program will wait forever for the sn
read to finish.  <esc> key aborts it ok, and then I
hit <q> to leave the update mode.

Back in normal mode, I had to <3> (reboot), because
sending the <s> (sn read cmnd) to sboot left it in
the middle of receiving a command.  The shortest 
command sboot takes is 3 bytes, and the sn read only
sends 1 byte before it waits for a response.

I looked at the mailbug code, and for some reason I had 
used the "read with no timeout" function when asking 
the mailstation to enter the dataflash mode, in addition
to the wait after reboot.  I changed the wait on entering
dataflash mode it to "read with timeout", and now trying 
to read sn on a mailstation with sboot gives 3 timeout errors
(takes 3 seconds) and then you get the prompt back.

I hope there was not a reason it was that way, that I 
just don't remember.  It seems to work better now, so 
I will leave it changed.  (I wrote the dataflash code 
over a year ago now, before I even started the codeflash 
routines.)

That's a real good idea.  Thanks! 
And I suppose it may be good to verify on entry
that the mailstation responds to the "update commands",
so we know there it is not already reflashed.

Right, mailbug will find it, regardless of project dir. 

I have been in habit of using <3> <4> sequence (from the main mode)
to verify communication with mbug.  Actually just <4> will verify
mbug is still there.  The <3> will put you back to boot code
(either sboot or mboot) and force mbug to reload.  But it
happens so fast, I usually just do both <3> <4>.

I just noticed a minor bug, the welcome message
does not display anymore on the older mailstations.
It still works, just no message.

If anyone is working with old ms, I can
post fix for just that.  Otherwise I will
wait till I have a few more things worked out.

There is a new version of hello world.
This one should display on either the new or old mailstations.

There is a .bat file that has the command to assemble
hello.asm to .hello.rom, with the necessary command line
options.  I uploaded both the source & bat as .txt, so
they can be viewed with web browser.

How do you make it so you can change the settings?

I am able to Hold Function-D and hit the reset button to boot into 
the "Reset System Data" menu with and without the "Restore Default 
Account" option.  I have selected "Restore Default Account" and 
answered Yes and tried No, but an unable to change the settings.  Is 
there something I am missing?

Okay, I'm back with another question. Assistance pliz.

I got through getting my own account set up okay (with my local
ISP...he was sitting in the room while I set it up...we didn't have
problems). I set up an account for my son (with NetZero), who will be
the eventual recipient of the test machine. I filled out the material
on the question screen (with appropriate x's where I don't want to
say):
==
User Name: xxx
Dial-Up No: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Reply-To: xxx@...
E-Mail Address xxx@...
E-mail Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx
POP3 Server: pop.netzero.net
SMTP Server: smtp.netzero.net
ISP Account: xxx
ISP Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx
Primary DNS: 0.0.0.0
==
I dial up the long distance number (there aren't any local to Ganado
TX <G>) and get the obvious modem sounds, logging on report, then it
hangs up and says that the service is unavailable or busy.

I don't think it is busy. I'm concerned that I don't know the DNS
numbers to plug in above. (Do I need them?)
I'm also concerned that I just used the email prefix (in my case just
three letters where I've shown xxx above) for the ISP Account and User
Name information should go.

Are these correct? I'm in the dark and can't really ask the free ISP
any questions. Has anyone here actually set up a free NetZero account
and been successful? If so, PLEASE help me out.

Trying desperately to get my adult son to communicate frequently by
email, as I know he leads a busy life and doesn't always just sit by
the phone for my calls. <g>

Thanks in advance,
Rick K5FNI
Ganado TX

If you click on the file I just uploaded, the name has changed, so you
won't see it. You actually have to go to the file
CIDCOHack.doc
I thought naming it just Mailstation.doc wasn't quite good for the
goup's folder use. It is okay on my machine to call it that.

Sri bout that,

pop.netzero.net

and 

smtp.netzero.net

are DNS names, so presumably you will need a DNS address to resolve
them. So I think you need to put one.

Until you find it, you can try replacing the DNS names the actual IP
addresses for the pop and smtp servers:

smtp.netzero.net 64.136.29.92
pop.netzero.net  64.136.28.166

Rick,

You do need the DNS numbers for the Mailstation to work.  You should be 
able to determine them by normally logging onto NetZero with your PC.  
Then, while logged on, run IPCONFIG on the PC.  The data that then 
appears on your screen should include the DNS number for NetZero.  This 
should work unless NetZero is providing a "dynamic" DNS, which changes 
each time you log in..

Also, the ISP account and password should be the same as the email 
address and password, since you have only one account with NetZero.

Also, be aware that Mailstation is limited to 8k bytes per email.  
Consequently, no images--just text.

Hope this helps.  If you need additional info, email me back, or contact 
Curt-W4QBU (we both have Mailstation 120s).

Rick,

One additional note for my previous response.

When running IPCONFIG, use the /all switch (i.e. ipconfig/all) to get 
the DNS numbers.

John, et al:

I'm gonna have to quit doing stuff in the middle of the night with no
sleep. ;)

I REALLY signed him up with Juno.com instead of NetZero.net. <sigh>
I tried to follow your instructions, but got no results. Here's what I
did:
1. I fixed the account setup in the MailStation from NetZero to Juno,
though I didn't know I'd have to erase all I had in there to do so.
<sigh>
 It now reads:
==
User Name: xxx
Dial-Up No: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Reply-To: xxx@n...
E-Mail Address xxx@n...
E-mail Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx
POP3 Server: pop.juno.com
SMTP Server: smtp.juno.com
ISP Account: xxx
ISP Password: xxxxxxxxxxxx
Primary DNS: 0.0.0.0
==

2. I tried to get the DNS entry for the POP3 server at Juno.com from
your instructions: I printed the results before connecting to Juno.com
and after and they didn't vary. I am using DSL with a WiFi
modem/router. I guess the command can't get through the router beyond
my ISP's DNS address. ?? Maybe someone else can get the address for
me. Sorry that I am unable to comply here. Lack of knowledge excels.
;)

3. I filled in the info as shown above and tried to send a test
message with the same results. Now it is possible that the thing is
actually busy, but the other time I tried it was VERY late at night.
This time it is mid-morning in Austin, where I'm calling to. Another
reason I don't think it is busy is that the device said it was
"Logging In" and the bar graph went across and the modem shut up like
it had actually connected and gotten beyond the handshaking stage.

I'm tapping my fingers on the keys and trying to have patience. It has
just been many years since I've actually had to mess with the vagaries
and frustrations of modem comms. <g> First, cable modem, then DSL have
both really spoiled me to just being confident that I can just march
in here and <zip> the machine is connected.

Thanks in advance for your help and patience.

73,
Rick K5FNI

Well the IP addresses I gave will probably only work for the service you
signed up for, so ignore the previous IP addresses.

To get the DNS entry for Juno you can follow Milt's instructions. Just
follow their instructions to get it to log in to juno from windows, and
then run either ipconfig from command prompt (under Windows NT, W2K, or
XP) or winipcfg from Windows 95, 98 or ME. This will give you the DNS
address. If you have the DNS address you don't need to resolve the smtp
and pop addresses by hand.

The point of this is, smtp.juno.com and pop.juno.com are DNS names. For
the mailstation to be able to send (smtp) or receive (pop) mail, it will
have to talk to actual servers and their actual IP addresses.
smtp.juno.com and pop.juno.com are not IP addresses. They are DNS names,
and normally can be traded in to the DNS server for IP addresses. But in
the example above, your DNS server IP is 0.0.0.0 so there is no chance
of sending mail in this configuration.

Now it is possible that the Mailstation could talk to the smtp server
and pop server if it has the raw IP addresses. But it might not. Best
thing is to put the DNS IP. Second best is to try again with JUNO's mail
server addresses.

If you just want to do a test without the DNS number, you might try
resolving the pop.juno.com and smtp.juno.com on your desktop PC. Just
open a ms-dos prompt and type

ping pop.juno.com

that will give you their pop Ip address

and 

ping smtp.juno.com

I got:

PING pop.juno.com (64.136.20.167): 56 data bytes
...
PING smtp.juno.com (64.136.21.93): 56 data bytes
...

I suspect neither NetZero nor Juno will work. I used NetZero for a while,
but it needed a Windows computer so it could put it's banner on the screen.
Also, it was very difficult to get on as even if you had unused time there
was some sort of limit on how many free users could be on the service at
once. YMMV.

http://www.netzero.net/signup/requirements.html

http://www.juno.com/signup/requirements.html

I'd look around locally for a cheap dial up ISP and make your best deal. If
you tell them you need 5 minutes per day max for email only they may make
you a good offer.

John,

Using both your values for the DNS, entered one at a time netted me
zero results different from last time. 

I did find an additional error pointed out to me by the firmware: the
user name I entered was erroneously entered by me as the email
address. The firmware notified me to take out the @ and try again. I
just put in my son's name this time. 

Still no worky.

I'm still appealing to someone who has had a free service work for
them with a Mailstation to get back with me here and tell me what you
did. Several folks said in the last month or so that they were going
to try a free service. Where are they? Hayelp.

John, the one problem I have with entering the two numbers is that I
don't know which to use or if there is supposed to be some general DNS
address entered. Obviously, neither works okay for Juno. <sigh>

I'm close to wit's end.

Maybe I should try another service?

No, I didn't give you a DNS IP address. Both of those are mail server
addresses. You need to replace each mail server with the associated
address.

Where you have configured pop.juno.com instead try 64.136.20.167

Where you have configured smtp.juno.com instead try 64.136.21.93

Gotta get it all right at once.

You just have to follow directions ;-)  And I need to learn to give
better ones.

Now, as I said Milt may be giving you better advice here: just get the
actual DNS address! To do this, you need to connect to Juno from a
Windows desktop as he described. Then you can find out from Windows what
the DNS server IP address after you connect to it.

Juno, netzero etc. may or may not work. But the MS probably does require
a valid DNS address, so until you've done a valid test with all
necessary parameters there's no reason to give up.

John, I did this with no different results.

Still looking for the above folks. I'll be patient and hope they read
their mail in the next few days.

As I reported earlier today, I do not seem to be able to do the
requested search on my machine, possibly due to it being behind a
WiFi/router. I seem to get the same DNS address whether or not I'm
logged in to Juno. Can someone else try this both ways and let me know
the address they find when logged in to Juno? With sugar on it?

Thanks,
Rick

Hmm... are you dialing up from your machine?

What OS are you running?

You need to 

a) Connect to Juno via dialup
b) Run winipcfg (Win98) or ipconfig (NT)
c) Look for your dial up adapter... it will either be in the dump
printed by opconfig, or a drop-down selection from Win98.

You should be able to find the DNS name there.

I don't have a Windows box with a modem, or I'd do it for you myself.

OK, I was able to set up an account and connect to Juno from my laptop.
The DNS servers for Juno are 64.136.20.120 and 64.136.28.120

Unfortunately though I cannot get a MS (Black DET-1) to send or receive
mail through Juno. It dials, but gives the same error that you
described.

Now, I connected again to Juno, and set up Outlook Express to collect
mail. The only thing I can get from Juno is an initial message that

"Access to Juno email using an off-line email program, such as Outlook
Express, is not available to Free members."

Since the MS can't use a webmail facility, there is no way to make use
of Juno with the Free account.  Is that what you're using? If so, I
think you'll need to find another service, and probably have to pay a
little bit. Or you could use Juno, but you have to sign for one of the
paid accounts. But I don't see much point to that... you are better off
finding a low price provider on the web.

That said, if you pay a little bit it's more likely they'll be willing
to help you get the thing set up.

No, I was using my XP Home machine and logging in via the Web.

I do own a Win95b Omnibook 800CT that has a PCMCIA modem. I'll try
that. I guess you finally did give better instructions. <g> I was just
flailing away with the XP box and not understanding why it didn't work
as it 'should'. Does winipcfg command work with Win95b?

Thanks for all your assistance. I've been leaving this thread on the
group, so any others having as much trouble as I'm having will see the
path we're taking to get to a (hopeful) resolution.

You should be able to call up and ask them for a
manual. They may or may not ask you if you have an
account, but from what I remember they should be able
to send you one. But then again thats before they
moved Mailstation Support to India. :( EARTHLINK
SUCKS.

Hi,

I also have a single user model.  It is not convenient if taking it 
on a trip, as it requirs a rebook to get isp settings changed, you 
lose everything during the process.

regards,

Apparently, some of the MS models will only allow 1
user setup initially, setting up other users is done
throught clipmail commands.

Since these are showing up everywhere, has anyone though of
reprogramming them into a functional PC assistant type device? 
What I think would be workable might be 
1 keep the flash update facility.
2 keep basic email ability
3 dump the spell checker and add some sort of programming facility.
4 add parallel port data exchange drivers and support for a simple
terminal emulation. 

What would be good would be something of the functionality of one of
the alphasmart laptops. Mailstations have a much faster processor and
much more memory than the old tandy 100s and there is still a market
for the tandy laptops.

If you can program in z80 assembler, "we have the technology".
We just need some code now...

There are at least 9 pages of 16k each available, without dumping
anything (except the out of date tv listings, etc.).  But I agree,
the spell checker is useless, and that is at least another page or 
three.

After loafing for several weeks, I've got back to looking
at this project, and made a lot of progress figuring out
how to integrate new apps into existing mailstation firmware.

I also have figured out how to dump the rom before erasing it.  :-)
(I started typing it up last night, but conked out before I
could post it.)  

It turns out that you can add the "Yahoo" type of app to 
*all* the mailstations, whether they have the yahoo/mycidco 
menu item or not.  They show up as icons after "settings"
if there is no yahoo folder!  
 
By yahoo type of app, I mean adding code that takes the 
place of the yahoo data.  I am not talking about adding
tv listings or weather or news.  The yahoo data is stored
as an executable program, and this program can be anything
you want (given that somebody writes the code).

I posted a file (Files>mailbug>Spew.txt) with
a mailstation app named "Spew", that sends
the mailstations firmware out the parallel port
when it is selected from mailstation menu.

Spew.txt is really the assembly listing spew.lst,
I renamed it so it is viewable with web browsers.
I am posting the assembly listing rather than 
spew.asm or spew.rom, because the listing has
the comments, the code, and the addresses in a
human readable form.  It needs to be entered
in hex on the mailstation keyboard (about 40-50 bytes).

There are instructions in the file on how to
poke it into your mailstation dataflash with
the mailstations built in hex editor.

I'm not posting the assembly listing here, because it
is too wide, and would get mangled by yahoo.  But
the source file is narrower, so I will paste it below.
If viewing on website, you can line columns up with
the "reply" button, without actually sending the reply.

------ spew.asm -------------------

; NOTE: You can't dump the rom after mboot or sboot is flashed,
;       because most of the rom is gone by then.
;
; This is code to be poked into dataflash on unit with yahoo 
; features active.
; HEY, it seems to work on units *without* yahoo feature, too!!!!
; (4.05E for instance.)
; It's purpose is to dump the coderom out of the parallel port,
; using the tribble code in page #01.
;
; *** One catch to using this is that it requires mailbug 
; *** version > 0.0.3, with the "inhale" function, to catch 
; *** the data.  And that version is not quite ready yet.  
; *** But you do not need it to enter this app into your 
; *** mailstation.  In fact, if you want to dump your rom, 
; *** you *have to* enter this in hex on the mailstation 
; *** keyboard.  That is because in order for mailbug to 
; *** write anything to dataflash, mbug needs to be loaded, 
; *** and loading mbug requires flashing sboot or mboot, and 
; *** flashing anything (to codeflash) will erase your rom.  
; ***   You have to do this BEFORE INSTALLING SBOOT!


bsendbyte equ #802D ; raises busy & sends byte.
; We use the existing sendbyte from original update code.  
; This means codeflash page #01 needs to be banked in to 
; slot8000 before calling bsendbyte.

done      equ #0000 ; Gotta go somewhere when done, we reboot.
; Mailstation will call eventhandler 3 or 4 times when you 
; select the new application, and we only want to exec once, 
; so we do not return at end, we reboot after first "event".
                    

; STEP 1)
; This is data from dataflash page #08, sector #00 (which 
; translates to a raw address of 020000), of a mailstation 
; with two apps:
;
; 020000  02 00 02 00 01 00 01 5e   1c 18 01 01 01 20 a7 19
;
; This is the key to enabling added apps!!!
; At least first byte above is needed, it seems to be count 
; of apps (2 in this case).  You need to poke it into dataflash 
; with hex editor at raw address 020000.
;
; Modify the first byte to match number of apps, including 
; new one.  If your mailstation already has app(s), and you 
; want to overwite one of them, you can leave this data as is, 
; and skip this step.  I don't know what the rest are, but those 
; 16 bytes are the only data in dataflash pg #08, sector #00.
;
; If you inc that first byte, without doing steps 2 or 3, you 
; should enable blank (or giberish) icons in the menu (under 
; yahoo, or extras).
;
; *** Enter Test mode with vulcan nerve pinch while booting:
;     <func><shift><t>, or <func><size><t> or on the newer
;     models, <func><q><a> followed by "qa781206" without
;     the quotes, of course.
;
; *** Enter Hex Viewer mode with <shift><f5>.
;
; *** Enable Hex Edit mode by entering "G710304x<enter>" without
;     quotes of course.  This is a "go" to a nonexising sector, 
;     and it will leave viewer on last sector of dataflash.
;
; *** Edit dataflash page #08 as described above. G020000 will 
;     get you to the right sector. <ctrl><s> will enter edit mode 
;     for current sector.  Edit the data.  <ctrl><s> will leave 
;     edit mode and save to dataflash.  You need to leave edit 
;     mode before moving to next sector.


; STEP 2}
; This is the start of our new app.  If your mailstation has 
; no existing "apps", then you would poke this into page #00 
; of dataflash (raw address 000000). 
; 
; If you already have say 2 existing apps, they are probably 
; in dataflash pages #00 & #01 respectively.  In that case you 
; would put this in page #02 of dataflash (008000).
;
; When using dataflash page #00, this goes at raw address 000000.
; When using dataflash page #01, this goes at raw address 004000.
; When using dataflash page #02, this goes at raw address 008000.
;
; (iow, in raw addresses, first app is at 000000, second at 004000,
; and third at 008000.)
;
; The JP instruction is the only thing in this part that is 
; absolutely necessary, if you can live with a captionless 
; menu entry.  The icon is gonna be blank anyways.
;
; *** Use hex editor to "go" to your address (G000000 or G004000 
;     or G008000).  This address corresponds to #4000 in the 
;     following app, no matter what page you are using.
;
; *** Enter edit mode, enter at least the bytes for the JP of

; STEP 3)

A good first step would be to port the SDCC Z80 target "standard
library" to work with the debugger loader.

My intent is to finish my port of CamelForth to MS... probably a day's
work, but it's just one of a list of projects I have going at the
moment.

I'm not sure I understand...  Do you mean work with

When mapping key scancodes to ascii, what should keys 
like "main menu", "print", "get email", or the 5 function 
keys return?  

"Back" could be mapped to ESC, since there is no esc key.
And maybe the 5 function keys (under lcd) should return
whatever is standard for f1-f5 on PC keyboard, but I don't
know what that is.

And what about the second "@" key???  I'm guessing same as 
first.

Both. sdcc already has a z80 target, But to do a simple program like
hello world someone needs to create an init and connect to whatever low
level i/o routines we have available.

It wasn't too hard to port to WP-2, another z80 laptop. Three or four
little subroutines to port, and you can start testing high level forth
code interactively at the prompt.

I had previously been unable to reconfigure the ISP on my MS 120 with
v 4.05e using the "reset during power on" trick. Although it produced
the "erase all settings" option, the Earthlink ISP settings were not
erased.

After using the information below about entering diagnostics mode and
choosing the FAST TEST option when the machine rebooted at the end of
the test the machine rebooted it had no ISP info and allowed me to
set up a new account. (Warning: FAST TEST erases everything in the
machine.)

Full sequence:
Hold down <function><q><a> and press power on. Continue holding
<fn><q><a> until a box appears on the screen.
Enter 
   qa781206<enter>
in the box.
Enter
   2
to choose FAST TEST.
The first four tests are quick. The ROM test takes about 20 seconds.
Wait for it. Eventually the screen changes to say 
Battery TESTING with a box below. 
The box will get filled in with 
Battery HIGH
Now hit <enter><Back>
and you're back at the Diagnostic Main Menu. Enter
q
to quit and reboot. You'll get the menu of options to clear various
things. It doesn't seem to matter what you choose -- the next message
is "Please create a new user account".

Enjoy.

After successfully reconfiguring the MS for my ISP (all2easy.net in this case) I found that I was not able to send mail to addresses other than all2easy.net subscribers. The message from the MS was along the lines of "server busy or unavailable, try later".

Investigation showed that the ISP SMTP server is configured to require an AUTH command and subsequent login in order to send mail to non-subscribers. This is an anti-spam feature. AUTH is a so-called ESMTP feature. My MS does not support it; with this ISP the MS can retrieve mail and send to other subscribers of the ISP but cannot send to other internet users. 

The only obvious solution is "get another ISP". I expect that ISP's will increasingly require AUTH for sending mail so the useful lifetime of the MS as an email appliance may be limited.

I had the same problem with NetZero.

I think unless we replace the mail client with new firmware you are
probably right about limited utility of the built in client.

Of course you could set up a linux dial-up server with whatever settings
you like.

You don't actually need a dial-up server to solve this problem: since the SMTP server's address is configured separately in the MS you just need to make your own SMTP relay server at a routable IP address. In fact this was how I figured out what was going on. 

There is an smtpd.py package in the python distribution that will do what you need--though anyone using it should take steps to avoid creating an open mail relay and suddenly finding themselves the purveyor of other people's spam.

Excellent point, Carl!  I hadn't thought of that. 

So one or more of us could set up a proxy server we could bounce our
SMTP packets off of to do the auth. Then we could use whatever dialup
server we like.

Anyone have ideas on what we could do to avoid becoming an open relay
since the client doesn't support smtp authentication?

-- John.

 Hello, group, this is my first post here, as I recently got a blue
det2 MS120 with 4.04e, which I was able to update the dialup and email
acccount into on thanks to users posts, not just here.  At any rate,
the useability of this machine is greatly reduced by the limitation of
pop3 and non auth smtp mailing.  I, for one, would love to see the
firmware updated to include these options, opening up other email
services such as those from the likes of AOL itself.  (for my
grandmother)
  The imap would not have to be complex, but just retrieve email form
one folder, the 'inbox', thus simplifying the programming.  Also,
'auth' could not be that hard?  
  For those of you asking the question 'how can we set up an auth smtp
relay without being taken advantage of spammers - here is how my
school does it:  They keep a record of recent (authenticated) pop3
logins and IPs, and only allow smtp mail from those.  Mial programs
usually check pop incoming mail first, and then the server would know
that it's OK to accept smtp session from that IP.  Jut a thought if
you're serious about setting up a server for users of the mailstation.
  Thanks to all for your great work on this unit, although from what I
see there is only a very basic debug shell and rom dump written in
assembly so far.  Where are all the z80 games that run on the ti-85
calculators? (that also use a z80 and pixel screen)  aah well.
  If we could just get smtp auth and simple imap protocol in these
units it would be fantastic.  Best of luck, and let me know if you do
so
 Andrew

Do you think it would work just to set up a proxy server somewhere on
the Internet? There was a discussion about this, and the idea was that
you can use any ISP you like, we just need a proxy server somewhere that
doesn't demand SMTP auth.

I guess your POP3-auth-first would work.

Why do we we need IMAP instead of POP3? Anyway if we're proxying it
anyway the IMAP could be supported on the other side of the proxy.

Well, IMAP can do a few things server-side that seem like they'd be
pretty painful on an appliance like the Mailstation. Plus you could
handle considerably more messages if you kept everything server-side
and just cached a handfull of them locally.

That said, I rather doubt the existing firmware is extensible enough
that you can add support for arbitrary protocols to it. There has been
some discussion of porting CP/M to the Mailstation, though. Are there
any IMAP-capable email clients for that?

OK, so the goal was to allow my grandparents to use their mailstation
120 at their vacation cottage to send and receive email using their
pre-existing AOL account, with no extra charge.

It has been accomplished.

  What I did was allowed them to use a dial-up account that came with
my DSL (so it was free)  and using my DSL I set up a server that
receives their pop and smtp requests, translates pop to imap, adds an
AUTH wrapper to their smtp request, and re-routes them to and from AOL.  

  It wasn't the simplest of things, but it was a fun challenge.  The
smtp translator was locked down to only allow requests from their
dialup IP range, and email will only be sent if it matches their user
account, so the likelihood of becoming an open relay is practically nil.

Cool!

Are you planning to make the script code available? Maybe there's a way
to make it more generic so that one or a few of us could setup proxy
servers for other users to connect to (without creating an open relay).

well, the first sending software I could find is smtp server pro. This
is not complex enough to send emails to different smtp servers based
on sender's address.  However, the mdaemon sales rep said that mdaemon
pro would be capable of doing this, so if you want to set up a group
server, that might be your best bet.  For the pop software, I modified
this:
http://www.kohsuke.org/imap2pop/
because this is open source, it could easily be modified to accept
multiple users.  Note, however, that you have to change its method of
getting the imap server address, because the mailstation uses the
BEGINNING of the from address for pop authentication, and for most
servers the from: address must match the smtp login name.

Why not just forward them to your desktop email address?

If the ROM can ever be figured out you should be able to reconfigure the 
printer port as an I/O port.

Because I cant connect the device to download my mails yet. The ISP
who provide the device in my country reserved for its own the
configuration. So, I need an email account of the same service. I read
that is possible to hack this 'ISP  protection' thing...so, can
anybody help me?
 Greats, YACO

Unfortunately, resetting the ISP configuration, if you have one of the 
Mailstations in which the setup is locked, currently requires a reset 
of the entire flash, erasing all of the email.

There is a work-around, though, for not having an account.  It is 
possible to set up a desktop computer (typically with Linux as the OS) 
with a modem to answer when you dial in, and to pretend to be the ISP's 
computer.  It might be possible to set this up yourself, or to find a 
friend who can do this.  I believe that there is further information on 
this in the archived messages.

Hope this helps,
Anthony Albert

Finally I could connect my device to download my mails trought my ISP...
but Im still loosing money in each call I have to make to cnnect it.
The soultion wouldbe a prallel conecction, almost in one direction: I
want to download my mails dorm the mailstation to the PC, but not put
data inside the mailstation from de PC...however, i still have to make
a programme to do that :(

The other solution is that you mention. But I think that I may need a
winmodem to connect the device to the computer, and everyone knows the
problems of GNU/Linux to support winmodems...If I could sort this
problem i need to know what program I need to run on the computer so
the mailstation belives its connected to a real ISP. It would be nice
that someone write something about this "emulation" or give me some
data to make it on my own. :D

I hope someone help me, thanx!

Why would you need a winmodem? Actually, there are drivers for some
winmodems for Linux machines. Some of these modems are interesting in
that they can act as an FXO allowing you to connect a Linux box running
Asterisk to a regular phone line.

This article gives some hope that you can just connect two modems
together with a regular phone cable.

http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0412.2/0560.html

ATA on the host and let MS dial in. 

Unfortunately I just tried this with a MS150 and a rockwell external
modem, no workey.

Typed ATA in terminal on rockwell side, and hit Get Email on MS. I had
to configure the mailstation to "ignore dial tone" but that just kept it
from timing it out. No connection is established.

Could it be configuration on modem side? Anyone have any ideas?

Some modems are line-powered. They use the phone line
to power the part of the modem circuitry. Connecting a
cross-over phone cable between a line-powered modem
and another modem, it won't work because the
line-powered modem won't have enough voltage to
operate. Line-powered modems are common in portable
devices and can be spotted by a REN (Ringer
Equivalency Number) of more than 0. Most phone
companies allow 2 REN. The phone lines use between 24
and 48 volts.


A winmodem on the other hand is an imcomplete modem
with most of the higher-level functions (like
compression and dialing ) handed off to  a software
driver. Winmodems are cheaper to manufacture, and can
be upgraded by changing a driver. And the drivers are
buound by trade secret agreements with Microsoft which
give Microsoft dominion over who is allowed to use the
modem.
if you have 2 phone lines at home, you can run a bbs
program on you PC, call the pc from the ms on the
other line and should be able to quickly work out the
signon dialogue, and simulate it on the PC. Ther is a
simple free BBS program called AddBBS that is written
in perl. Also perl is available free of charge for
almost every OS in existance.

I have been looking through some documentation from
the Rabbit Semiconductor website and I noticed a
couple of interesting things.
First, there is an an on chip parallel port that is
bidirectional and can be used as a printer port or to
reprogram flash memory. 
Second, If I read it correctly, the slack space in the
flash memory is the result of a limitation of the C
compiler in the development kit.

My mother had mailstation several years ago but stopped it.  She 
wishes to restart it however in doing searching on the net I don't 
find much - I get sent to earthlink who apparently now operates 
it.  The monthly cost for an earthlink account is over $20.  Does 
earthlink still support mailstation and if so what is the monthly 
charge.  Don't want to go the computer route for her as mailstation 
is confusing enough.

Thanks,

It's possible it may be able to use another ISP - possibly a free one. What 
exact model and ROM does it have?

See the files in our files section.

BTW, I suspect that EarthStation will bail out on this system in the near 
future.

The Mailstation is still quite a handy device, and is an inexpensive 
way to send/receive email.

I don't know how much longer Earthlink will continue to support it, but 
the Mailstation can be used with other Internet Service Providers 
(ISP).  There are instructions on changing its settings in the files 
sections of this group.

You might want to look into low-cost ISP in your area, or perhaps even 
a local small-business ISP.  While $20 per month is pretty standard, 
there are a few places offering dial-up access for about $10 per month, 
including an email mailbox, which the Mailstation can access.

Hope this helps,
Anthony Albert

Hi.
I have 3 mailstations I collected in the past 3 years or so. Each of 
the 3 DET1's has a firmware version which allows me to put in ISP 
settings, POP3 server, smtp server, passwords, etc. I was going to 
distribute some to my relatives so we could email easily, but a 
problem came up.

Up until about 15 months ago I had been using one of them with my 
AT&T email account. But suddenly it stopped working. After much 
investigation and NO HELP FROM AT&T, I determined that it was the 
XTND command coming from the Mailstation which was causing an error 
message on the mailserver which basically killed the whole process.

I've tried to find other free email services which can tolerate the 
XTND command by either ignoring it or coming back with OK but not an 
error message. But I have been unable to find an email service which 
will work.

Does anyone in the group have the name and/or address of an email 
provider I can use which WILL work with my mailstation ?

Has anyone figured out how to hack the code to avoid this issue ?

BTW, I'd be willing to sell at least two of them if someone is 
interested. They are LIKE "NEW".

Thanks in advance,
Mark

Hello everyone,

    I have a Mailstation 250 (model DET2B, firmware V1.12 XTND:ON) that 
isn't taking kindly to my adventures in repurposing.  I have tried every 
key combination I can think of, but the only promising sign I get is a 
"Scanning Memory Data..." progress bar on startup with a menu to reset 
system data.  It seems I'm not much of a hardware hacker...can anyone 
out there give me some hints on what I'm doing wrong? A step-by-step 
guide or FAQ for this model would also be a great help for any n00bs 
like myself who came along.  Thanks for reading! :)

Indeed, it does raise privacy concerns.  Reliable and complete deletion 
of (possibly) sensitive information should definitely be on the list of 
any refurbishement operation...   My guess is that they just didn't 
give it any thought at the refurb place, just assumed the reset would 
do the trick.  With flash memory, though, that's not enough - I think 
there should have been a ROM routine included for doing just that.

Hi Chris,=


It's Shift-F5 (from test mode), to enter hex viewer mode.

From there, an=
 interesting key sequence is
g710304x<back>

Then try function-s
You will f=

I find it both useful and interesting!  Useful, because it inspir=
ed
me to take another look at the file structure from the hex-viewer.
I hav=
e been trying to understand the file system by examining the
code.  But the=
re were several details that hadn't really clicked 
into place.  Looking at=
 some files after knowing a little bit about
the structure provided a coupl=
e of big "AHA!!!" moments.

And interesting, because it raises the question=
 of just where the
responsibility lies for protecting the privacy of data t=
hat is 
locked inside of an appliance with non-removable and non-volatile
m=
emory.

I tend to believe it should be the users responsibility.  But maybe=

as consumers, we need to demand a privacy policy from the
manufacturers an=
d dealers of these kinds of devices?

I work a lot with used computers, and they often have
old data on them. I will usually backup the data, and
hold it until I can verify that the previous owner
doen't want it, at which time I delete the backup.
MOst of the time the former owner is unreachable or
doesn't want the old data.

instructions already in place to d=

All I want to do in turn XTND off or at least=
 change the strings to

  0C1D30 in the rom

ell.  06bab0 has 
a couple of strings but thats all they are for what I kno=
w.  So 
basically what I want to do is change XTND to something that wont

The Rabbit cpu used in the mailstations have a
hardware flashmemory function that works through the
parallel port. I don't know how to access it through
the printer port, but someone on the list probably
does.

Why do you think it is a Rabbit cpu???  It does not even 
come close to mat=
ching the pinouts of the standard 
Rabbit chips that I am aware of.  As far=
 as I know, 
it is not a Rabbit part.  

In my personal opinion, it is a cu=
stom ASIC.

But there is a built-in reflash function, in *software*.  
One =
of the things that my "mailbug" debugger does is 
interface with this nativ=
e reflash capability 
(via parallel port & laplink cable), allowing you to =

re-program the mailstations codeflash.

So far, the only thing *I* have fl=
ashed in any of my 
mailstations is code that lets me boot up the remote 
d=
ebugger.  But it can be used to flash whatever you want.
Ferinstince, if so=
meone was inclined to write completely 
new firmware, mailbug can flash it =
into a stock mailstation.  
Or, if you just want to make some changes to ex=
isting 
mailstation firmware, it can reflash with your modified 
firmware.
=

I have been working (Ha!) on a new version of the boot code
(code that boo=
ts up the remote debug functions of mailbug)
that can be used without erasi=
ng the existing mailstation 
code.  (The native reflash erases most of the =
codeflash 
*before* you get a chance to "back it up".)

This new version wi=
ll (when I get it working) let you load
and execute your own code over the =
laplink, without killing 
the existing mailstation code.  It also will let =
you save
to disk an intact image of your particular firmware version.

Afte=
r saving your firmware to a file on PC, you can edit it
with whatever tools=
 you like, and then flash your new 
version back to your mailstation.

If y=
ou are working with mailstation firmware 2.53yr or 2.54, 
you can do this n=
ow, with the currently posted mailbug 0.0.3.  
There are images of those tw=
o firmware versions in the group 
download area.  So, for those two, you do=
n't really need to 
save your own images.

One catch, mailbug 0.0.3 will no=
t let you change the first
four pages of codeflash with the native reflash.=
  If you 
load the remote debug boot code, then you can flash anything
anyw=
here.  Mailbug 0.0.4 will flash the whole codeflash
without needing to load=
 the remote debugger.

Of the 2 that I have ( 1 120 and a 150 ) the 120 has a
rabbit chip in it. It is apparently a discontinued
part that was replaced by the 2000. The Rabbit 2000 is
functionally similar. both are based on a Z180
compatible core. I'll have to take a peek at theh
150's innards and see what it has.

Are you saying that you have something other than
the 3SI176 chip,=
 or that the 3SI176 is a Rabbit part?

I have opened up a lot of different =
models, and found
the same chip in all (3SI176), except for the 350, which
=
had a Toshiba TMP91C820AF.

These are the models I know of:

I opened up my other one and it has the
 same chip set. Several months ago I did find the 
part number on a chip directory, which listed it
 a rabbit semiconductor CPU as compatible. I think
the 3si176 is a chinese clone.

Can you get the details on both chips (and any
differences)?  I have tried many times to get hardware
and programming specs from various mfr's, but they are
only willing to selling the chips.

I have 2 mailstation 350's, one is a version 1.37 and the
other is a versio=
n 1.39.

If I do a Power up with Control, Q, A, held down on the 
1.39, I g=
et a input box, I have tried the qa781206 data,
and it comes back and says =
"wrong ISP".

If I do the same Power up with the 1.37, it comes up in
diagn=
ostic menu mode.

When you check something, and then Quit and re-power, the=

setup menu comes up, with everything cleared,

HOWEVER, you can NOT get in=
to the "email Address" line.
If you try to SAVE, a box says that all entrie=
s have to be filled and 
then takes you to the "email address line".  But y=
ou can NOT enter
anything in it ???????

In the tests, which are:
1. S/A te=
st 1. LCD
            2. keyboard
            3. Rom
            4. RAM

There is an OPTION to "CLEAR FLASH" ??????????
If I Cleared the flash=
, would that JUST clear the email and network 
entries, or clear ALL the PR=

Also on the main screen is a place for the S/N and ship ID,=
 but I can 
not seem to get into that area to write anything ??


Any sugge=

On mine (350 v1.37), when I do ctrl-q-a qa781206  I get the 
message "T=
his device can't recognize the ID, please contact
your service provider."

=
The version info under the menu setup>mailstation> is
V.1.37 XTND:ON C

I d=
on't know what the C means.

Is this the same on yours?
I wonder what might=
 be different?

That is how mine beha=
ves when I hold ctrl-d while booting, and then 
interrupt it (reset button)=
 while it is doing the "restore factory 
settings".

To get past the part w=
here it insists all entries be filled, but 
will not let you fill one of th=
em, I have to restore factory settings 
again, without interrupting.

I have never got this=
 menu on a 350.  Can you get it into
the hex edit mode?  On the other model=
s, from the first
test mode menu, you enter a ctrl-f5 to start the hex edit=
or.

I don't know for sure, but my best guess is it would o=
nly clear data,
and not code.  If I could get mine to this point, I don't t=
hink I
could suppress my curiosity, and I would just try it.  
But that's m=
e.  :-)

The fact that they call out rom & flash separately in the menu wou=
ld
seem to suggest that they are calling the codeflash "Rom", and the
dataf=
lash "Flash".

What's in those areas now?  The serial number is on a =
sticker 
on the bottom of unit, maybe ship ID is the other number on that 
=
sticker?

The older models just display the sn at the bottom of the
test mo=
de menu.  You can't change it on those models.

BEWARE OF TESTING FLASH ON 350!!!!!  (more below)

I figured out the correct id for 350's, but not the master.
It =
is based on the serial number (sticker on bottom).
If your serial number is=
 SN023903xxxx
then the ID would be qa350xxxx

This also works for the 120's=
 & 150's, but it is qa120xxxx
(it's qa120xxxx even on the 150).

I tried qa=
783508 for the master instead of qa781208, 
            ^^^                =
                ^^^
but it did not work.

Maybe the "C" means "closed", as opposed to "open",
(iow, "locked" or "un=
locked")???

I got to the test mode=
 menu now, but ctrl-f5 does not work
to put 350 into hex edit.  :-(

I didn't yet try the "CLEAR FLASH", but I did try the 
"TES=
T FLASH" option.  It apparently cleared out the
"factory setting" values, a=
nd now I cannot get out of
the "can't set email, and can't quit till you se=
t email"
infinite loop.  Oh well, I will try some more, and maybe
the "CLEA=
R FLASH" will get me out.

Hi,

As far as I know, there is no way to turn it off.  Without
hacki=
ng the code that is.  I don't think even Earthlink/Cidco 
could turn it off=
 for you.

How high did you want to set it?

The mailstation has less than =
365k bytes of flash maximum
for the inbox.  If you have any address book da=
ta, or calendar data,
or saved email (inbox, outbox, or sent folders) there=
 will be even 
less.

Cool! I got into the hex editor on my 150, had to press ctrl-shift-f5.
What can you do in the hex editor?  Write Z80 machine code?  How do you 
execute it?  The memory seems to contain mostly zero bytes except for a 
few hundred bytes at the end.

I should have said shift-f5.  That works on all but the 3=
50,
and puts you into a "secret" hex-viewer mode.

If you want to actually =
edit some bytes, you need to enable
the "double secret" hex-edit mode.  Typ=
e G710304x<back>  :-)
(uh... without the smiley, of course!)

After enablin=
g, ctrl-s will shift you into edit mode.  Another
ctrl-s exits edit mode, a=
nd saves the new bytes to dataflash.
Each screenful in hex edit mode is a s=
ingle 256 byte sector of
the dataflash.  You have to save each sector befor=
e you can
move to another sector.

You can=
 edit any byte in the dataflash.  The first 5 pages
of dataflash can contai=
n 5 applications.  Control is transfered
to the first byte of those pages w=
hen you select the corresponding
icon from the mailstation menu.  You add t=
he apps to the menu
by editing the "app count" in page #08 of the dataflash=
.

If you form your app code like the mailstation wants, you will
have an i=
con and caption as part of your app.  The mailstation
will display it in th=
e menu, under "Yahoo" if you have a
yahoo folder, or under "Extras" if you =
don't have a yahoo folder.

If you don't include icon & caption, you will j=
ust get a
blank space in the menu, or maybe a garbage icon if your
code sit=
s where the icon is 'sposed to be.  It's pretty
obvious where the new item =
is regardless of whether you
include icon.

I found out, the hex editor seems to be read-only.  Maybe it needs a 
different password to allow writing.

Sounds like you are in plain old hex-v=
iewer mode.

You need to *enable* edit mode after you get in viewer mode.

=
Then, you need to kick it into edit mode for each sector.

Biggest problem is trying to find where to unlock the area
that has the ent=
ries for the email address.

They couldn't get this unit to go on the syste=
m because the s/n was 
still being listed under somebodies account. (Probab=
ly paid up front 
for a full year, and then sold it), and the other unit I =
have, sends 
out OK, but will not receive the "special email" that changes =
the 
unit over to the NEW account.  SO I am stuck !!!!

If I can get into t=
he Email address area and change it, then I can 
start using it on the Mail=
station account already setup.

The 1.37 version is now blank, and can't ge=
t back in the area.
The 1.39 version brings up the "entry box", which I cou=
ld get into, 
but if I wipe out the Flash, then I have 2 dead units.

Is th=
ere a way to get into it to read one, and then re-program the 
HEX on the o=
ther ???

Just need to find a way to unlock that unit to re-program it ???

A couple/three questions:

1) What is afte=
r the V.1.37 on the setup screen???  In particular, is 
   there a "C" afte=
r the "XTND:ON" (or "XTND:OFF")????

2) Did you blank the acct data by test=

   or did you do it by interrupting the "re=

3) Did you try restoring factory settings to fi=

Unfortunately, just about everything w=

this thread of the last few days.  As far as I =
know, you are the
first to get a 350 into test mode.  :-)

That's a really good question, I did not see what difference the
test menu's did ??  If I get some spare time (yeah right), I will
setup something to run some of those tests.

The thing somebody needs to do is setup something on a server that is
offline that can be setup as the DNS address that the mailstation uses
to send to Earthlink, and see what user name and password it uses to
access that account.

Then a email can be sent back to the mailstation to change the data
on the email address and password from the info we already know about
what it needs to do that.

I believe that it gets a MD5 code related to its serial number (and address)
and then is told to change to what ever email address and password that
earthlink sets up for a customer account.

I have one unit that will send to earthlink, and receive that info,
but it will not change to the new account that we setup with them.
That is the version 1.39 that I have.  The Version 1.37 I have could not
be setup with them because the serial number could not be cleared from
somebody else's account. Even though they had sold it to me.

As far as the Flash programming, we will have to track down exactly
what chips are in use in the unit, and computer type, and then see
how the CPU bus is setup.

A Jig of some sort will have to be made to allow the parallel port
on the mailstation to connect to a Parallel port on a computer. Otherwise
the TTL voltage from both will burn out each other.  There needs to be
some sort of OPTO-ISOLATOR chips or something in between.

Actually, what we need to find out is WHO made this unit and try to get
some documentation on it.

Since Earthlink is NO longer selling these units, and will phase them out
in the future, you would think that they would be a little more forthcoming
with some documentation.  If I was them, I would be trying to fix or program
as many of these units as I could to get the monthly income.

However, there does not seem to be anybody that repairs or re-programs these
units ???

Always new people here. Welcome!

CJ has already worked all this out and there is software in the files
section. No special hardware is required, just a standard parallel port
"laplink" cable.

It is a waste of time to try to develop for the mailstation any other
way than using CJs tools that he has worked so hard on.

The mailstation is already "cracked" long ago. Now it just needs some
new software developed for it.

The thing somebody needs to do is setup something on a server that is
offline that can be setup as the DNS address that the mailstation uses
to send to Earthlink, and see what user name and password it uses to
access that account.

Then a email can be sent back to the mailstation to change the data
on the email address and password from the info we already know about
what it needs to do that.

I believe that it gets a MD5 code related to its serial number (and address)
and then is told to change to what ever email address and password that
earthlink sets up for a customer account.

I have one unit that will send to earthlink, and receive that info,
but it will not change to the new account that we setup with them.
That is the version 1.39 that I have.  The Version 1.37 I have could not
be setup with them because the serial number could not be cleared from
somebody else's account. Even though they had sold it to me.

As far as the Flash programming, we will have to track down exactly
what chips are in use in the unit, and computer type, and then see
how the CPU bus is setup.

A Jig of some sort will have to be made to allow the parallel port
on the mailstation to connect to a Parallel port on a computer. Otherwise
the TTL voltage from both will burn out each other.  There needs to be
some sort of OPTO-ISOLATOR chips or something in between.

Actually, what we need to find out is WHO made this unit and try to get
some documentation on it.

Since Earthlink is NO longer selling these units, and will phase them out
in the future, you would think that they would be a little more forthcoming
with some documentation.  If I was them, I would be trying to fix or program
as many of these units as I could to get the monthly income.

However, there does not seem to be anybody that repairs or re-programs these
units ???

I wonder if QA stands for Quality Assurance and is a code to be used
by that department?  So there would be other codes (like DEV for the
development department ?)  If not, who originally figured out the QA
scheme ?  Also, in the menu, there's S/A and F/A if I recall

OK, now I'm confused...

I didn't know anything about the ISP Password.

I =
was using the QA trick, i.e. hold q and a down during boot, then 
enter the=
 qa-password into the text-box that pops up.  The qa-
password was qa350xxx=
x where xxxx is the last 4 digits of the serial 
number.  All of this acord=
ing to Cyrano, and it works, but didn't 
help.  I did a flash test and flas=
h clear, now I can't use the damn 
thing because restoring factory settings=
 doesn't put the defaults in 
(email address).

I suppose the ISP password =
would bring up some new options, I've got 
to try this tonight.

John,
from what I saw in the "files" section was about cracking the
100 and 150 version mailstations. So far I have not seen anything
on getting into the 350 units??  That is what I need to do !!!

Always new people here. Welcome!

CJ has already worked all this out and there is software in the files
section. No special hardware is required, just a standard parallel port
"laplink" cable.

It is a waste of time to try to develop for the mailstation any other
way than using CJs tools that he has worked so hard on.

The mailstation is already "cracked" long ago. Now it just needs some
new software developed for it.

These are mailstation 350's.........version 1.37 seems to come up in the
"diagnostic" menu, if you
hold down the "Function, Q and A" keys on the keyboard and turn the power on
or RESET the unit.

Have to hold them down UNTIL the menu comes up !!

Version 1.39 comes up with a "Login" box, which requires you to type in "QA
???????" relating to the
serial number of the unit.  Then you should get the Diagnostic menu.

So far, other testing the unit, and clearing the "flash" memory, I can't see
what use this menu is to
getting things re-programmed.

The unit S/N and SHIPID is located in the lower left of the unit.

If you test "Flash" or "Clear Flash", then when you re-power it up, all data
is cleared from the
Setup and Network areas.  Problem is that the unit will NOT let you into the
"E-mail Address" on the
Setup screen.  If you hit the "Save" key, then it tells you to enter all
data, and if you press OK,
then it goes directly to the "Email Address" location, but will NOT allow
you to enter anything in it.

You are effectively locked out from using the unit from there on.

Even resetting the "Factory settings" by the "Function and D" keys gets you
nowhere. There is NO
factory data in the "Flash" anymore to put back in the unit.

The ONLY hope is to either find a way to get into a HEX editor on the unit,
or to re-load the info
from the Parallel port via another computer.

Wayne

  [\quote]

  what menu? and how to get it ?

  btw the ISP password for the default account is found in such a manner

  if the serial number is 024189046 , the ISP password is , Ze09814 that is
remove the last 2 digits and enter the digts backwards and 02 stands for the
year of manufacture.i think you guys already know that.. but i dont know how
to get the menu...

    That's a really good question, I did not see what difference the
    test menu's did ??  If I get some spare time (yeah right), I will
    setup something to run some of those tests.

    The thing somebody needs to do is setup something on a server that is
    offline that can be setup as the DNS address that the mailstation uses
    to send to Earthlink, and see what user name and password it uses to
    access that account.

    Then a email can be sent back to the mailstation to change the data
    on the email address and password from the info we already know about
    what it needs to do that.

    I believe that it gets a MD5 code related to its serial number (and
address)
    and then is told to change to what ever email address and password that
    earthlink sets up for a customer account.

    I have one unit that will send to earthlink, and receive that info,
    but it will not change to the new account that we setup with them.
    That is the version 1.39 that I have.  The Version 1.37 I have could not
    be setup with them because the serial number could not be cleared from
    somebody else's account. Even though they had sold it to me.

    As far as the Flash programming, we will have to track down exactly
    what chips are in use in the unit, and computer type, and then see
    how the CPU bus is setup.

    A Jig of some sort will have to be made to allow the parallel port
    on the mailstation to connect to a Parallel port on a computer.
Otherwise
    the TTL voltage from both will burn out each other.  There needs to be
    some sort of OPTO-ISOLATOR chips or something in between.

    Actually, what we need to find out is WHO made this unit and try to get
    some documentation on it.

    Since Earthlink is NO longer selling these units, and will phase them
out
    in the future, you would think that they would be a little more
forthcoming
    with some documentation.  If I was them, I would be trying to fix or
program
    as many of these units as I could to get the monthly income.

    However, there does not seem to be anybody that repairs or re-programs
these
    units ???

    I wonder if QA stands for Quality Assurance and is a code to be used

Thank you, Wayne.
   
  I dont want to try that in that case. If the Unit is cleared out what use is it going to be? can we put the settings back in anyother way if we can get the thing to dial out? I can provide you with a copy of the configration mail. If that is helpful to you or CJ. 
   
  Can you pls let me know how to do the diagnostic test on the screen? Function + F5, right?

      These are mailstation 350's.........version 1.37 seems to come up in the "diagnostic" menu, if you
  hold down the "Function, Q and A" keys on the keyboard and turn the power on or RESET the unit.
   
  Have to hold them down UNTIL the menu comes up !!
   
  Version 1.39 comes up with a "Login" box, which requires you to type in "QA ???????" relating to the
  serial number of the unit.  Then you should get the Diagnostic menu.
   
  So far, other testing the unit, and clearing the "flash" memory, I can't see what use this menu is to
  getting things re-programmed.
   
  The unit S/N and SHIPID is located in the lower left of the unit.
   
  If you test "Flash" or "Clear Flash", then when you re-power it up, all data is cleared from the 
  Setup and Network areas.  Problem is that the unit will NOT let you into the "E-mail Address" on the 
  Setup screen.  If you hit the "Save" key, then it tells you to enter all data, and if you press OK,
  then it goes directly to the "Email Address" location, but will NOT allow you to enter anything in it.
   
  You are effectively locked out from using the unit from there on.
   
  Even resetting the "Factory settings" by the "Function and D" keys gets you nowhere. There is NO
  factory data in the "Flash" anymore to put back in the unit.
   
  The ONLY hope is to either find a way to get into a HEX editor on the unit, or to re-load the info
  from the Parallel port via another computer.

The thing somebody needs to do is setup something on a server that is
offline that can be setup as the DNS address that the mailstation uses
to send to Earthlink, and see what user name and password it uses to
access that account.

Then a email can be sent back to the mailstation to change the data
on the email address and password from the info we already know about
what it needs to do that.

I believe that it gets a MD5 code related to its serial number (and address)
and then is told to change to what ever email address and password that
earthlink sets up for a customer account.

I have one unit that will send to earthlink, and receive that info,
but it will not change to the new account that we setup with them.
That is the version 1.39 that I have.  The Version 1.37 I have could not
be setup with them because the serial number could not be cleared from
somebody else's account. Even though they had sold it to me.

As far as the Flash programming, we will have to track down exactly
what chips are in use in the unit, and computer type, and then see
how the CPU bus is setup.

A Jig of some sort will have to be made to allow the parallel port
on the mailstation to connect to a Parallel port on a computer. Otherwise
the TTL voltage from both will burn out each other.  There needs to be
some sort of OPTO-ISOLATOR chips or something in between.

Actually, what we need to find out is WHO made this unit and try to get
some documentation on it.

Since Earthlink is NO longer selling these units, and will phase them out
in the future, you would think that they would be a little more forthcoming
with some documentation.  If I was them, I would be trying to fix or program
as many of these units as I could to get the monthly income.

However, there does not seem to be anybody that repairs or re-programs these
units ???

I wonder if QA stands for Quality Assurance and is a code to be used
by that department?  So there would be other codes (like DEV for the
development department ?)  If not, who originally figured out the QA
scheme ?  Also, in the menu, there's S/A and F/A if I recall
correctly... What does that stand for ?

According to CJ's documentation (and I may be incorrect), a boot-
loader is=
 invoked by the MS that looks for something on the printer 
port.  Presumab=
ly with the right s/w on the PC, it should be possible 
to re-load the flas=
h with what was there before.  In other words, 
someone would need to back-=
up their flash from the MS into a file, 
then we could try and load that fi=
le back into the MS, making it 
useful again.  That's all assuming that CJ'=
s software/hardware works 
on the 350.

What is this documentation you refer to?
....Oh.  That doc=
umentatation.  

I just took a look, and I see it does not mention the fact=
 
that mailbug does *not* work with the 350.  
I need to fix that!  

That'=
s a pretty big oversight.  I guess I was just
taking for granted that anybo=
dy who actually read the 
doc had been reading the group messages.  

http:=

http://groups.yahoo.com/g=
roup/mailstation/message/245

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/mes=
sage/205

At the time when I wrote that manual, I thought everybody was
awa=
re that the 350 was a different animal than all the others.
But I will defi=
nately add that to the manual.
My bad.

Yep I was wrong, sorry! Didn't catch the 350 part of the story.

That said, how different is the 350 supposed to be?

The most significant differences I can see are the=
 CPU 
is different, the display has 16 gray-levels, and it
does not respond=
 to the same update protocol that the 
earlier models use.  

Also, it uses=
 SDRAM (I think it is 2MByte), and it has 
4 MByte of flash.  There are two=
 identical flash chips, 
each 2 MB.   

I added a link to a data sheet for =
the Toshiba TMP91C820AF 
to the group's links section.

I don't have any pl=
ans at the present to pursue this,
but you never know...

Mailbug is a program I wrote that will let you loa=

your own code, in either the mailstation flash or ram.

On the older DET1 models, you power up=

You don'=
t need this menu to install and use mailbug
version 0.0.3.  

Installing sb=
oot.rom (required with mailbug 0.0.3) will 
wipe out most of the original f=
irmware in your mailstation.
If you would like to keep your original firmwa=
re intact,
you might want to wait for version 0.0.4 (hopefully
ready in jus=
t a few more days).

There is no compiler yet.  Can you program in z80 as=
sembler?  

A free cross-assembler (as80) is in the file area, under mailbu=
g
directory.  There is also a "hello world" example.

Well there are lots of C and Pascal compilers for Z80. Most of them need
to run under a CP/M emulator and target a CP/M environment, but whether
generated code is dependent on the environment is usually a function of
the nature of the code itself, not the compiler.

There's also sdcc which comes with full source code.
http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

To my knowledge no one has used these with Mailstation yet. If you want
to generate short swaths of code I think you wouldn't have to do
anything special. If you want to use the standard library they provide,
you'll need to modify them so that they use the built in I/O routines or
you need to write your own i/o routines.

This compiler targets the Z80.  Although I have not used it for the  
Mailstation, I imagine that it will generate compatible machine code.

Thanks !=
 
I've used parallax 8051 assembler to make my pic programs in the past
so =
im going to see if AS80 works for me, im not shure about the C or
pascal co=
mpilers.
So i hook up my laplink cable, then load mbug (in msdos) and then =
i
power on my DTE1, im i right thats the procedure ?

These are usually the easiest ones to alter to a new ISP. Have you looked at 
the files on the group home page?

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/files

Look at Cracking. FN+Shift+T or FN+Shift+Size should get you into the menu.

I wonder if or when Earthlink will abandon this URL? Might be worth grabbing 
if it becomes available. Should be able to renew it for $8 per year.

I have models with firmware ver=
sions 2.22R, 2.52R and 2.53YR,
and they do *not* allow you to set the pop3 =
or the smtp
server fields (even with the sh-fn-T flash test method).

I als=
o have models with higher firmware versions, such as
2.54Y, 2.55Y, 3.03a, 4=
.03M, 4.04B, 4.04E, 4.05D, and 4.05E,
and I am pretty sure that all of thos=
e can be set to any
server, using the various methods listed elsewhere.

My=
 guess is that the "R" means that the server is "restricted",
(or some othe=
r word that starts with R and means similar thing). :-)

Since i'm on subje=
ct of firmware version numbers, it doesen't 
seem to big a stretch that the=
 "Y" stands for the "Yahoo" tie in.

Making some wilder guesses, the 4.04M =
is a Mivo 200.
3.03a is the revised 3.03, with "new color" (ivory as oppose=
d 
to brown).

4.04B might be a revision of the 4.04 (if there even is a 4.=
04 
or 4.04A), or else it might just mean "blue case".

Wilder still guesse=
s, perhaps the "D" and "E" stand for domestic
and export??????????

If anyo=
ne has any firmware versions that are not in the table
in the database area=
 of group, feel free to add yours!

Wel=
l, that didn't work too good.  It was supposed to be a link to
the table, t=
hat was sorted on the firmware version field.

If you manage to find it any=
way, and you sort on that field, it
will put them in roughly chronological =
order.  Except for the
1.xx versions (250 & 350) which I think came out som=
ewhere
between the 2.xx and 4.xx.  I don't have any idea why they are
not i=
n sequence with others.

It is possible to do this... however, it's not easy.  The components 
are:

 - PC with modem and phone line
 - Software for dial-in TCP/IP access, so the PC can accept the call 
from the Mailstation
 - DHCP service on the PC, to give out IP address to Mailstation
 - DNS on PC, to respond to the Mailstation's request for name 
resolution of "mail.mymailstation.com"
 - SMTP on PC, to accept mail
 - POP3 on PC, to hand mail to mailstation
 - remailler software on PC, to send/receive email with the rest of the 
Internet, and also to re-write the headers so that the mail can come 
and go.

This would be, in my opinion, easiest to set up with Linux, but it 
should be possible to do it with Windows.   I seem to recall, in the 
early days of the group, a report of someone actually doing this, but 
efforts since have been focused on finding ways to change the settings 
in the Mailstation, or to re-program the Mailstation.

With Windows 2000 an newer you should everthing except
the mail server and forwarder by configuring incoming
connections. 

I have been trying to do something similar on linux,
but I am having trouble to get "bind" (the linux dns
service) configured like I want.

Any version of Linux would work, I believe.  The trick that is noted in 
the posts on linux-hacker.net is to point towards your own DNS server 
software, which can hand out IP addresses for the POP3 and SMTP server 
names, which point to your own server.

I am trying to do that now with a Compaq Clipper and
Debian Linux. You need a dhcp server to assign an IP,
a ppp server to make the connection and bind (dns
server) to fool the Clipper into thinking it's on the
internet.
So far I have got the bind configuration just right.

You have to load on the Apache Linux Server software onto that computer.
You are looking at around $ 500. if you buy it, or get it "Free" on the
Internet, but then YOU have to load and configure it yourself !!!

The Apache server has the mail server in it.   www.apache.org

you will also need to install bind9 (the dns server),
dhcpd and ppp. Configuring these on linux is a lot
esier if you install Webmin. 
PPP makes the connection.
dhcp assigns an IP sddress
bind9 is the Domain Name Service
Webmin is a web based system configuration utility.
The idea is to configure Bind9 as a master server and
map you mailservice name to you server ip.

I just finally was able to get Earthlink to make a 350 unit
switch to an em=
ail account on their system.

Seems that the 350 units do NOT use the same =
setup process
message that all the other units do.

After several attempts =
by the 3rd world techs there to get this unit to 
turn on, they called in a=
 real technician somewhere back here in the 
states, and He sent the correc=
t data stream to the device, and then it 
was working in a few minutes.

I =
find that quite interesting !!!!

I still have one 350 unit which we wiped =
out all the memory on,
and I can't seem to figure out how to program it bac=
k up again.

If anybody has gotten anywhere on this model, give a shout bac=
k !!

They needed to know the model number and the serial number.

The first 2 times the tech in India tried it and it would not 
switch over, so I called irate, and then they said that they would
have to get ahold of a "real" technician, and it was suddenly working
within the hour.  So I would assume that whatever the standard data
stream that they send the mailstations, the 350 takes something
different in or on it ??

Well since you seem to know what is needed here, how do I ask to get another
unit turned on
next time ???
I have another 350 unit, that I want to replace a current model 100 unit
with.

We tried to do that about 6 months ago, but ran into the same problem, in
the fact that
they could NEVER get it to change over and go to the setup mail account from
it's serial
number account.  It sends mail out OK, so I know it works.

Up until I put this last 350 in service, I just thought that it was broken
somehow.
But when the other 350 unit would not convert to the mail account also, I
bought a
3rd unit. It did the exact same thing.

It was not until I raised the fact that I would not pay for a NEW account
that I did not have any
equipment on that worked, that they said that they had to get a SENIOR
Technician to
do something. About 2 hours later, that unit changed it's programming and
set itself
up on the account like it should have.  It is working fine now, (And YES, I
did pay the
account up at that point).

So what do I have to tell the Phone person to correctly get this other 350
unit setup,
and transferred to my other account that I have the model 100 on ??

thanks,

Wayne

PS, I think the mailstation service is great, especially for those that are
not computer
geeks like us.  The system works great in most cases, except for it's lack
of being
able to view larger emails.  But I have had one for my Mother (age 75)(Model
100)  for several years now,
and She is thrilled with it and I just got one (model 350) for my Aunt and
Uncle (75 years).
The ONLY way that we can get good constant communications with these people.

If Earthlink decides at some point to discontinue this service in the
future, please advise us
at that time how to change these units for other services !!!  Thanks !!

  No thats not the case. The service in mailstation 350 is the same, but the
mailstation itself takes the data differently. its the hardest mailstation
to tech, unlike the other mailstation models which are quite easy.

  a tech from india :)

    The first 2 times the tech in India tried it and it would not
    switch over, so I called irate, and then they said that they would
    have to get ahold of a "real" technician, and it was suddenly working
    within the hour.  So I would assume that whatever the standard data
    stream that they send the mailstations, the 350 takes something
    different in or on it ??

    I wish we knew what that data stream was. Did they need to know the
model
    etc.?

Well,
Govind C,
Please tell me what I need to tell the person on the Tech phone when I call
them ???
I tried to have this Model 350 changed to my account (from the current model
100), and
it would not change over like the last model 350 unit I setup.   I again
called and they sent the message,
and it would not change over.  I know it works because I can send a message
from it to other
email addresses OK.

Is there something or somebody I should ask for that knows what is needed to
make it change
over ???  It is a Version 1.38 model 350   serial number is 0239028999

thanks,
wayne

  No thats not the case. The service in mailstation 350 is the same, but the
mailstation itself takes the data differently. its the hardest mailstation
to tech, unlike the other mailstation models which are quite easy.

    The first 2 times the tech in India tried it and it would not
    switch over, so I called irate, and then they said that they would
    have to get ahold of a "real" technician, and it was suddenly working
    within the hour.  So I would assume that whatever the standard data
    stream that they send the mailstations, the 350 takes something
    different in or on it ??

I tried it and it still did not change over, so I did the Hard Reset like
you suggested, and then pulled the
batteries out and did it again.  It still will NOT change over, it connects
OK, logs in to the server,
then says "No Mail", then logs into the "Send mail server", and then says "0
messages sent".

800 number they gave me is 800-520-3236 ......

This is a Model 350 version is 1.38

Is there any way to re-load the "factory defaults" back into it like the
model 100 does.
Maybe there is something glitched in there somewhere ???

Although everything looks like the other unit did, and they were finally
able to get that to work !!

Any suggestions ???

my email is waynem@...

thanks,
wayne

  Hi Wayne,
  I checked on your account. The "clipmail" can be viewed on the webmail. I
had given the way to login to the serial number account some while back. It
should be working for you now. If not, do a hard reset and then change the
dialup number to the 800 number given to you and try.

  Regards,
  Govind C

    I tried to have this Model 350 changed to my account (from the current
model 100), and
    it would not change over like the last model 350 unit I setup.   I again
called and they sent the message,
    and it would not change over.  I know it works because I can send a
message from it to other
    email addresses OK.

    Is there something or somebody I should ask for that knows what is

I forwarded the Webmail to the serial number email address, which hopefully
is just the
serial number @....  The model 350 did not receive it. Can you
check to see if
the test message I sent is in that mailbox ??

If it is then I may have a bad mailstation, as it does not seem to want to
receive any mail,
although I have no problem with sending it out.

Wayne

  Hi Wayne,
  I checked on your account. The "clipmail" can be viewed on the webmail. I
had given the way to login to the serial number account some while back. It
should be working for you now. If not, do a hard reset and then change the
dialup number to the 800 number given to you and try.

  Govind C

    Please tell me what I need to tell the person on the Tech phone when I

    I tried to have this Model 350 changed to my account (from the current
model 100), and
    it would not change over like the last model 350 unit I setup.   I again
called and they sent the message,
    and it would not change over.  I know it works because I can send a
message from it to other
    email addresses OK.

    Is there something or somebody I should ask for that knows what is
needed to make it change
    over ???  It is a Version 1.38 model 350   serial number is 0239028999

    thanks,

    No thats not the case. The service in mailstation 350 is the same, but
the mailstation itself takes the data differently. its the hardest
mailstation to tech, unlike the other mailstation models which are quite
easy.

  <DIV>I checked on your account. The "clip=

Hi,
I've carefully read all data on this board regarding LCD pinouts and
th=
e work flow approximations. (Message #38, and the .doc file)
With this info=
 and and some coffee i decided to hack the LCD module of
one of my 2 mailst=
ation DTE1, and hook it up to the parallel port of
my PC.
Of course i reali=
zed there's not enough data on this matter to proceed
with this task (timin=
gs, and so on...), i know most of the
documentation for this little baby is=
 done by pure brute force hacking. :)
Still i wonder if any one has reached=
 some level of communications
with the LCD ????
Any help will be very appre=

  Hi,
  I've carefully read all data on this board regarding LCD pinouts and
  the work flow approximations. (Message #38, and the .doc file)
  With this info and and some coffee i decided to hack the LCD module of
  one of my 2 mailstation DTE1, and hook it up to the parallel port of
  my PC.
  Of course i realized there's not enough data on this matter to proceed
  with this task (timings, and so on...), i know most of the
  documentation for this little baby is done by pure brute force hacking. :)
  Still i wonder if any one has reached some level of communications
  with the LCD ????
  Any help will be very appreciated.

I'd love to replace the main board with one of my own.  I'd have to build a
driver for the LCD display or find a way to salvage the existing one.
 
I want to build a custom wireless serial terminal and the mailstation is an
excellent form factor for that.

Let me save you some time and hassle, if by what you are saying as a
wireless serial
terminal you mean something to call a paging company, and enter a page, then
it
would be cheaper and easier to go to EBAY and pick up an Alphamate or
Wordsender
unit.  They are already setup to do that, have a modem in them, and are
pretty cheap,
between $ 10 to $25 each.

If you mean to send SMS (texting) to your cell phone, then you are going to
have to do a lot
of work and then find a program that will do SMS from whatever CPU unit you
have
hooked up to that mailstation. I don't think the CPU chip on the mailstation
will work for
that use, it probably does not have the sufficient memory to run a SMS
program.

However, some carriers (both Paging and Cellular) do have an Email gateway
(SMTP), that will let you
send an email to your Pager or Cell phone number.  In that respect, the
mailstation would work
as it was originally configured, and would just send an email to that
address.  The Carrier's
gateway computer would then get it and send it to your Pager or Cell Phone
unit.

You can either sign up with Earthlink or re-configure the DET1 by the "hack"
on here and
get on somebody else's ISP service.

I need a portable TTL serial device to communicate with microcontrollers. I
use serial communications to debug software and a wireless, portable device
would make my life a lot easier. I use a laptop now which is overkill for
what I need. I want to write a custom interface specific to the projects
that I do, primarily robotics and home automation. I've already decoded the
keyboard and built a prototype board, but I had to go with a different
graphic LCD which doesn't fit the original case.
 
There are a few handheld serial terminals available commercially but none
have the formfactor of a mailstation.

Let me save you some time and hassle, if by what you are saying as a
wireless serial 
terminal you mean something to call a paging company, and enter a page, then
it 
would be cheaper and easier to go to EBAY and pick up an Alphamate or
Wordsender
unit.  They are already setup to do that, have a modem in them, and are
pretty cheap,
between $ 10 to $25 each.
 
If you mean to send SMS (texting) to your cell phone, then you are going to
have to do a lot
of work and then find a program that will do SMS from whatever CPU unit you
have
hooked up to that mailstation. I don't think the CPU chip on the mailstation
will work for
that use, it probably does not have the sufficient memory to run a SMS
program.
 
However, some carriers (both Paging and Cellular) do have an Email gateway
(SMTP), that will let you
send an email to your Pager or Cell phone number.  In that respect, the
mailstation would work
as it was originally configured, and would just send an email to that
address.  The Carrier's
gateway computer would then get it and send it to your Pager or Cell Phone
unit.
 
You can either sign up with Earthlink or re-configure the DET1 by the "hack"
on here and
get on somebody else's ISP service.

What is it you are trying to do with this LCD unit ??
Maybe there is a better way ???

Hi,
I've carefully read all data on this board regarding LCD pinouts and
the work flow approximations. (Message #38, and the .doc file)
With this info and and some coffee i decided to hack the LCD module of
one of my 2 mailstation DTE1, and hook it up to the parallel port of
my PC.
Of course i realized there's not enough data on this matter to proceed
with this task (timings, and so on...), i know most of the
documentation for this little baby is done by pure brute force hacking. :)
Still i wonder if any one has reached some level of communications
with the LCD ????
Any help will be very appreciated.

Benjamin.

Thanks for the suggestion guys.  Since I want to make it wireless, I'll end
up needing to customize any unit that I find. I was considering the mail
station because of the graphic LCD, but I may take a look at the Tandys and
see if I can hack the LCD in one of those. I've not had much luck on the
mailstation so far...

Here are a few laptops ready to work for this purpose:

Model 100, 200, 102
Tandy WP-2
Cambridge Z88
Amstrad NC100, NC200

All have similar form factor to the Mailstation, and actually have much
better keyboards. They all have a built-in terminal program. The WP-2, Z88,
NC100, NC200 will give you an 80 column screen. However I like the
simplicity and the community of users of the Model T: Tandy 102 and Tandy
200 myself, though these units only have a 40 column screen.

No, we still want to do that. It's a matter of time - it's not a trivial ta=

I haven't given up.  It has been probably more than 6 months si=
nce
I have done much, though.  Kind of burned out I guess.  It does
seem to=
 be capable of sucking up an unlimited amount of time!  :-)

I would bet that the timing i=
s not important, as long
as you don't try to go too fast, and I would guess=
 that
the parallel port would not be able to go too fast for the LCD.

How =
are you gonna make the physical connection?  That is probably
the hardest p=
art.  Oh, and you will need a latch or a counter,
since parallel port does =
not have enough bits to drive the LCD data,
address, and control signals di=
rectly.

But what I would recommend for controlling the LCD is the mailstat=
ions
CPU board.  It has the right connector for the LCD ribbon cable,
and h=
eck, it is even already plugged into it!

There is an examp=
le "Hello World" program in the files section,
http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=
p/mailstation/files/Mailbug/mailbug_0.0.3/hello/

That hello world prog wil=
l work on the old or the newer mailstations.

There is a more complex examp=
le, with scrolling screen output and
keyboard input, but it is just for the=
 older mailstations.

If someone could figure out:
1/ how to stop the Mailstation from sending th=
e XTND command, that 
would make it useful again on many POP3 services. Whe=
n it send the 
XTND command and gets -err back, it basically decides the ma=
ilserver 
is busy and disconnects. Some old POP3 servers ignored the XTND a=
nd 
did not send -err but many today do send the -err and make the 
Mailsta=
tion useless for email.

2/ if someone could figure out how to make the mai=
lstation 
authenticate for sending mail as many POP3 services now want 
aut=
hentication to prevent spammers from using their servers, we could 
use the=
 mailstations with many more POP3 services.

Essentially, what you need is a full decode of the program that is in the
mailstation !!

The place to start, is the US patent office, and look at the patent's that
are on the unit.
After reading one of them it gives you an idea of how the unit works, and
what format it
uses to do that with.

But what is needed is for somebody that understands the program language or
code that
it is programmed in to dump it out on paper, and then it can be
re-constructed to do what is
needed.

I used to work with the Z80 code, way back in my life time. Now I think they
have a computer
program that will take the data and print the programming out for you.  On
the newer units,
I am not sure what computer code they are using ??

We still have not really figured out how the parallel port programs the unit
on all versions
at this point. That is needed to fully allow anything to happen.

I would like to find who the manufacturer of the unit is ??  Somebody built
these, and it
wasn't Earthlink ???  It would even be nice to be able to have a unit
re-programmed to the
original programming, or get a unit repaired.  Earthlink cannot repair these
units nor direct you
to anybody that can !!!

Unfortunately, there are some people who do know these units but can only
talk about them
so much because they are still being used by Earthlink, and those people
have contracts with
Earthlink to provide services for these units.

If Earthlink ever decides to drop the units, and no longer allow them on
their system, then maybe
these people would be able to talk about the units and their programming
more. But until that happens,
I can understand why they would be reluctant to come forward and discuss
anything.

Although, it would be helpful to get some direction on getting bad units
repaired or reprogrammed so
they could at least go back in service on Earthlink !!!!

As far as the units using XNTD signaling ??   I would assume that the unit
could be reprogrammed to
eliminate that signal.  If you have an Email server you have control over,
you could probably change the
"Sendmail" or "Procmail" program on it to ignore or use the XNTD signal.
But that is not the only
item that this mail program does. It uses an MD5 encryption code for the
unit.  That code has to be
sent correctly for the unit to program and possibly work correctly.  It can
only be sent in a MIME format,
which leaves out most of the mail formats from sending it.

What I am really surprised is, that NOBODY else has come out and built a
mail machine to do something
similar ?? You would think AOL or somebody else would do that ??  I know
there is a use for the machines,
I have 2 units out there at my relatives.  They are not that computer
literate, but they can use the mail units
easily, and now they can't live without them. So somebody could build a unit
that would work on any POP3
system and easily sell it !!!!  All you need is a couple of 800 telephone
trunks, and an Email/DNS Server
unit, and you are in business.  Just steer clear of the "Mailstation"
patent.  I don't think POP3 has a patent,
but the "mailstation" unit does, so you would have to make a unit that was
designed strictly for POP3,
and was an open architecture, with none of the special MD5 keys and such
that the mailstation was using.

Good luck !!!

Wayne

The mailstations were originally sold under the brand
name Cidco. The processor is not actually a z80, but a
z80 compatible microcontroller with several
enhancements, including several on-chip serial and
parallel ports. The cpu appears to be a either a house
numbered and or discontinued variant of a Rabbit
Semiconductors 2000. Rabbit Semiconductor does not
list the processor, but it is similar to the chips
used in some of the TI programmable calculators.
Somewhere on this board is a complete memory dump of
one of the models.

Is there such a beast as a mailstation emulator? The
would be the way to go for testing and debugging new
code..

It might be easier to hack the base unit for a
mailstation 350 wireless to bypass the modem. As for
the tandy 100s and wp2 laptops, the serial ports are
not ttl compatible, but in the case of the model 100,
they have a system bus that is accessible.

You'd need to analyze the code to make one. This sort of work has been done 
before, as in the TRS-80 computers which were thoroughly analyzed.

At this point, I'll probably scavenge the parts I need from a couple of sou=

  It might be easier to hack the base unit for a
  mailstation=
 350 wireless to bypass the modem. As for
  the tandy 100s and wp2 laptops,=
 the serial ports are
  not ttl compatible, but in the case of the model 10=
0,
  they have a system bus that is accessible.

Th=

You said "The cp=

Rabbit
Semiconductors 2000".  

Can you tell us why it appears that way???

I could be wrong, I often am, but here is why I
think it is *NOT* a Rabbit=

1) The pinout does not match any Rabbit part.  Not even close.
   A=
re there any discontinued Rabbit parts?  I think the 2000 may have
   been =
the first part they made.

2) There appears to be no ROM or RAM built into

   the 3SI176 (it has an address and data bus).  The mailstations
   codefl=
ash, dataflash, and ram are all in external chips.
   So, It would not have=
/need a way to program internal flash.

3) If I remember correctly, the Rab=
bit parts have extended
   opcodes that z80 does not have.  Mailstation cod=
e
   appears to use just standard z80 opcodes.

4) The rabbit bank-switchin=
g seems quite a bit different than the 
   mailstation's.  The mailstation =
does bank-switching more like
   the MSX, Gameboy, and Avigo.

It has been =
a few years since I did my research on this 
subject, but that is what I re=

If anyone has one, they haven't said anything about

I think we know enough about the mailstatio=

The mod=

The base unit is essentially a cordless phone base=

And the main unit has what amounts to the cordless 
handset built in.

Yo=

There would be less work to do to just develop code directly on real
hardware, given the existence of Mailbug, Z80 assemblers, C compilers
(like SDCC), etc. You would need to adapt the standard library to
mailstation but that's less work than having to reverse engineer and
document every component in the mailstation which is what would be
needed to make an emulator.

That said there are already CP/M emulators around which can run raw
Z80 code, so you could do testing for large swaths of code in a CP/M
environment.

Anyway it's more fun to develop on "the real thing." At least that's
my bias as an embedded systems developer. WIth mailbug you're doing
"target debugging" anyway, so you get the advantages of working on a
desktop while testing code on a real Mailstation.

350 base unit also has an internal modem, as it has a telephone plug in to
bypass
the wireless unit.

  The modem is in the main unit.

  The base unit is essentially a cordless phone base.
  And the main unit has what amounts to the cordless
  handset built in.

  You would need another modem at the base end to recover
  serial data.

Hi All,

My wife's aunt, has Earthlink and the Mailstation 350.  She is 73 =

years old and this represents the only way she can do email, which 
has be=
come very important to her.  Initially, she was able to 
sporadically recei=
ve emails.  Now, none are getting through.    

After going through which w=
as her valid email account (i.e., the one 
with the number, the name@mailst=
ation.com) and making sure we were 
sending plain text, she is still not re=
ceiving any email on the 
Mailstation 350.  Her outbound email does work.

=
We have logged on to the web client - www.earthlink.net - and we are 
able =
to see her emails, but they don't get through to her.  Does 
anyone have an=
y ideas on this?  Can the Earthlink customer service 
people help?  

In pr=
evious discussions, a "hard re-set" has been mentioned.  How is 
this done?=
  Unfortunately, we don't have the manual.

Appreciate any help and thanks =
to all of you.

A few questions and then some suggestions !!

One: Is the email account "Overloaded". There is a limit to the email
accounts memory.
Go delete anything that was over a week or two old. Then check it again.

If she can still send email, then the unit sounds like it is working OK.

TWO: Can you do a manual "Get mail" by pushing the email button, and see if
it connects and
gets the mail ??? If that is OK, then the "Times" that the unit goes to get
mail is off or bad.

THREE: Check the "settings" to see if everything is still correct, or was
changed somehow ???

If it is still not working, call Earthlink tech support, and ask them to
"RE-load" the authorization
for the unit.  You will need the serial number of the unit. You must be able
to verify that you
have the authority to call in for this account.

DO NOT DO A "RESET" without tech support directing you to do it !!!

I have a couple of units for my older relatives, that aren't "computer
savvy", at first they were
very skittish to try the units, but now they can't live without them. They
have become parts
of their lives. They are now able to almost instantly communicate with their
friends and relatives,
and that improves their quality of life !!!

Wayne

I did find a listing for the part number on a chip
broker site that listed the mfr as rabbit
semiconductor. At the time, It was apparently produced
at an asian factory under contract to rabbit. From
what I can tell, Rabbit was bought out by a larger
company, who made it a subsidary. They seemed to
reorganize and dropped the old lines the came out with
the much enhance series that included the 2000. My
guess is it had to do with intellectual property
rights.

You are most likely correct. However, even Zilog
extended the original Z80 opcodes with later chips. It
may be likely that the TI inventec chip and the 3SI176
are "first cousins" so to speak. 
I metasearched the part and found several chinese chip
brokers have them available, and some may have
datasheets. Unfortunately, I don't know chinese.

So are you familiar with the Z80 chipe in the TI calc?

This site has some info on TI Avigo PDA.
The 6SI117 CPU is made by Inventec=

I have read a lot of web pages regarding Inventec, and I get the
im=
pression that they are a *HUGE* company.  They make notebooks and
pdas and =
phones for a lot of other companies.  They also make 
the iPod for apple.

=
Googling [inventec z80] finds this site:
http://72.14.203.104/search?q=3Dca=
che:lao-3vhKzuoJ:electro-tech-online.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D15332%26sid%3D=

=3D1&client=3Dfirefox-a

Well, that link will likely be garbled.  It was
to=
p hit for that search, and I had to view it via 
googles cache, because pag=
e seems to be gone now.
 
The pertinent part of page was a post asking for =
info:

There was no answe=
r posted.  Note the manufacturer,
the similar part number, and most curious=
ly the "PDARD".
I believe the Avigo 6SI117 also says "PDARD", but I can't
f=
ind a good picture of it right now.  In case it didn't
jump right out at yo=
u, the Avigo is a PDA, as in PDARD.

I don't have any guess what the RD sta=
nds for, but
RSDRD ends with RD, too.  I have not been able to come
up with=
 any meaning for RSD as of yet.

Googling for [rsdrd inventec] returns two =
sites
that list 3SI176 as manufactured by "RSDRD".
The line just above 3SI1=
76 is for a 3SI0870A manufactured 
by "Inventec". 
http://www.digchip.com/d=
istributors/parts/3s/parts_3s.php

I think the brokers are just jumping to =
conclusion
that the RSDRD is the manufacturer, because for some
reason, the=
y did not print "Inventec" on the package.

I don't think it is a Rabbit 2000, but an earlier
design that the 2000 replaced.

Forgive me for asking (I haven't pulled out my Cidco 120 for a couple 
of y=
ears), but what is the simplest way to transfer plain old text via 
the par=
allel port to a PC?  I really could use a portable text editor,

Neil,

Thanks for your reply, but...

Hmmm, why would I want to?  Because I=
 do?

I would like to simply use it as a small, rugged text editor/word 
pr=
ocessor.  I would like to for the same reasons one would pull out 
a notepa=
d and take notes, or use a laptop to type a letter on a 
train.  With the p=
arallel port, there muse be some way to export the 
text to a PC, no?

Ther=
e must be some way to use it for this outside of the modem.

Thanks for any=
 suggestions,
Kevin

1)
My wife just picked up a DET1 v2.55Y at a garage sale this weekend 
for =
$2 and I've been trying to get it to work.  I was able to reset 
it and ent=
er new info, but could only create one user account.  Is 
there a way to cr=
eate additional users without calling EarthLink?

2)
I found a dialup ISP, =
www.bamnet.com, that has local dialup service 
in the small town where an e=
lderly aunt lives in Upper Michigan.  
They charge only one cent per minute=
 with a prepaid account.  With 
thousands of dial up numbers around the cou=
ntry, this looks like a 
great option.  I cannot get my email from my ISP o=
nce I am logged 
into the internet, but I can use my company's email server=
 to 
receive messages, but not to send.  I am currently setting up a test 
=
Windows 2003 server for pop3 and smtp access and will experiment 
with that=
 here shortly.

3)
With great dialup access to the internet, wouldn't it be=
 feasible 
for someone to host a simple pop3/smtp server for use for 
MailS=
tation type of appliances?  I realize protections are needed to 
keep the s=
pammers off, but that should be easy by limiting these 
accounts to minimal=
 settings needed for dialup and only a few 
messages at a time, I would thi=
nk.  Does this sound reasonable to 
you?  If so, then why hasn't somebody d=
one it?

4)
Are there any more of the free dialup ISPs left, or dialup emai=
l 
providers?  All of the big providers are having to lock down their 
syst=
ems, charge for services, and create roadblocks that these 
simple little m=
ail terminals can't seem to handle without a major 
effort to rewrite code =
and rewrite the PROMs.

5)
Do you think providing this type of service, par=
ticularly for the 
elderly and perhaps specialty markets like RVers would b=
e feasible?

Thanks,

PS  If I can get everything to work I will be happy t=
o publish all 
the info I find, and about Bamnet, if you think it would be =
useful 
to anybody on this group.

Part of the problem is the mailstation uses the "Control X" (Xtnd) character
in it's
email sequences.  Most email services will not except that as part of the
login,
and handshakes for email delivery.

Somebody probably could setup an email server that would work with this, but
they would have to overcome 2 questions ??

1. Would using this particular email protocol be infringing on Earthlink's
patent?
And would they then get into a lawsuit from Earthlink over using it ?

2. How would they pay for the 800 number dial-up telephone lines to access
the system ???
You want the service for "FREE", but somebody has to pay for the facilities
somehow ???
Would you except SPAM delivered to you, with the money paid for that
advertising to pay
for the facilities ???  Or would you be willing to pay a monthly fee for the
email service ??

An 800 number would run about 5 cents per minute, with 2 calls per day from
the Mailstation,
about 2 minutes each, that is about $ 3.00 per month, plus the cost of
running the server unit,
the electric, and providing any accounting staff to handle your payments.  I
would say that
you would need about $ 5.00 per month to break even.

  1)
  My wife just picked up a DET1 v2.55Y at a garage sale this weekend
  for $2 and I've been trying to get it to work. I was able to reset
  it and enter new info, but could only create one user account. Is
  there a way to create additional users without calling EarthLink?

  2)
  I found a dialup ISP, www.bamnet.com, that has local dialup service
  in the small town where an elderly aunt lives in Upper Michigan.
  They charge only one cent per minute with a prepaid account. With
  thousands of dial up numbers around the country, this looks like a
  great option. I cannot get my email from my ISP once I am logged
  into the internet, but I can use my company's email server to
  receive messages, but not to send. I am currently setting up a test
  Windows 2003 server for pop3 and smtp access and will experiment
  with that here shortly.

  3)
  With great dialup access to the internet, wouldn't it be feasible
  for someone to host a simple pop3/smtp server for use for
  MailStation type of appliances? I realize protections are needed to
  keep the spammers off, but that should be easy by limiting these
  accounts to minimal settings needed for dialup and only a few
  messages at a time, I would think. Does this sound reasonable to
  you? If so, then why hasn't somebody done it?

  4)
  Are there any more of the free dialup ISPs left, or dialup email
  providers? All of the big providers are having to lock down their
  systems, charge for services, and create roadblocks that these
  simple little mail terminals can't seem to handle without a major
  effort to rewrite code and rewrite the PROMs.

  5)
  Do you think providing this type of service, particularly for the
  elderly and perhaps specialty markets like RVers would be feasible?

Yep it's long gone. They dropped the free dialup and
email service well over a year ago. I hated the to0

for a device that can capture parallel port data
cheaply, how about a parallel port crossover (aka
laplink ) cable. Someone would need to write the pc
side of thing, but wit a modern PC with a
bidirectional printer port, it shouldn't be difficult.

Do you foresee that Earthlink is going to drop the Mailstation service,
or are they going to continue providing it ??

YES, it would be interesting to know about the Xntd control.  But I am sure
that an email server running the "Sendmail" program could have the program
changed to allow the use of the Control character if needed ??

Actually at $ 9.95 per month ( $ 12.95 for model 350 units), they should be
making some good profit on the
service ??   There is really not much that you need to supply to provide
that service, so hopefully they will
keep it.   IF not, I hope that they will allow "openness" on the programming
and such for the units, so they
can be used for those that really NEED them.

I actually am finding that more Elderly people are looking at the service,
and I have put 2 units in service
for my Elderly relatives.  Since these people have not grown up among
computers like we have, they are
"Computer literate", and are afraid of using a regular computer for email
service.  But since they have used
a typewriter in their lifetime, the "Mailstation" is manageable for them !

I know that both my relatives were hesitant at first, but you would have to
break their arms to get their
Mailstations away from them now !!

Just wish I could find another Model 350 that worked good, or figure out why
this one I have won't switch
over to the correct account.  The Model 350 is so much nicer to use !!!

  1. The answer is no , I have come accross mailstations that had both
"Xtnd: OFF" as well as "Xtnd:ON" . On that note i really dont think it
matters. I could look further into this if you guys wish.

    Part of the problem is the mailstation uses the "Control X" (Xtnd)

the login,
    and handshakes for email delivery.

    Somebody probably could setup an email server that would work with this,
but
    they would have to overcome 2 questions ??

    1. Would using this particular email protocol be infringing on
Earthlink's patent?
    And would they then get into a lawsuit from Earthlink over using it ?

    2. How would they pay for the 800 number dial-up telephone lines to
access the system ???
    You want the service for "FREE", but somebody has to pay for the
facilities somehow ???
    Would you except SPAM delivered to you, with the money paid for that
advertising to pay
    for the facilities ???  Or would you be willing to pay a monthly fee for
the email service ??

    An 800 number would run about 5 cents per minute, with 2 calls per day
from the Mailstation,
    about 2 minutes each, that is about $ 3.00 per month, plus the cost of
running the server unit,
    the electric, and providing any accounting staff to handle your
payments.  I would say that
    you would need about $ 5.00 per month to break even.

      Subject: [mailstation] Dialup Access


      1)
      My wife just picked up a DET1 v2.55Y at a garage sale this weekend
      for $2 and I've been trying to get it to work. I was able to reset
      it and enter new info, but could only create one user account. Is
      there a way to create additional users without calling EarthLink?

      2)
      I found a dialup ISP, www.bamnet.com, that has local dialup service
      in the small town where an elderly aunt lives in Upper Michigan.
      They charge only one cent per minute with a prepaid account. With
      thousands of dial up numbers around the country, this looks like a
      great option. I cannot get my email from my ISP once I am logged
      into the internet, but I can use my company's email server to
      receive messages, but not to send. I am currently setting up a test
      Windows 2003 server for pop3 and smtp access and will experiment
      with that here shortly.

      3)
      With great dialup access to the internet, wouldn't it be feasible
      for someone to host a simple pop3/smtp server for use for
      MailStation type of appliances? I realize protections are needed to
      keep the spammers off, but that should be easy by limiting these
      accounts to minimal settings needed for dialup and only a few
      messages at a time, I would think. Does this sound reasonable to
      you? If so, then why hasn't somebody done it?

      4)
      Are there any more of the free dialup ISPs left, or dialup email
      providers? All of the big providers are having to lock down their
      systems, charge for services, and create roadblocks that these
      simple little mail terminals can't seem to handle without a major
      effort to rewrite code and rewrite the PROMs.

      5)
      Do you think providing this type of service, particularly for the
      elderly and perhaps specialty markets like RVers would be feasible?

      Thanks,

      PS If I can get everything to work I will be happy to publish all
      the info I find, and about Bamnet, if you think it would be useful
      to anybody on this group.

I'm not all that familiar with this whole area but because I have a

use the Rex anymore but do ha=
ve a bunch of files saved that have the
source code for some small apps and=

The mailstations I would love to make into a portable word proce=

(for me) and a pre-schooler's "laptop" for my grandsons.  Is that
anyw=

Hi,

The short answer is: "no=
".

A longer answer: Not without a lot of work.
Any input or output, or for=
 that matter any calls
to the OS would have to be mapped to alternative
cal=
ls to the mailstations OS.  Unless, by some unlikely
coincidence both the r=
ex 6000 and the mailstation
have the same low level firmware.

> I rarely

rce code for some small apps and games.  

Is the source code in C or assem=
bler?

I had never heard of the Rex 6000 before now, but I googled it,
and =
spent some time reading about the hacking efforts last night.
Seems they ar=
e quite a bit further along than us!  (Heck, they were
further in 2001 than=
 we are now!!!)

Although the hardware is quite similar, I imagine there wo=
uld be
a lot of work involved in porting a rex 6000 app to mailstation,
not=
 the least of would be reversing the existing mailstation OS,
or writing a =
new one.

At one point there were a few group members who wanted to
complet=
ely rewrite the firmware.  I haven't heard much lately
about any efforts in=
 that direction.  My own plan was to reverse
enough of the existing firmwar=
e so that we could use the existing OS,
but that isn't moving very fast, ei=
ther.

Define "feasible"...  =

There is a big book that is available every year that lists EVERY chip made
by part number,
and who the manufacturer is.  I have a very old one 1980's, I will check in
it, but you
probably need to find somebody that has a new one and look it up.

Also, the RD at the end means R & D, as in research and development...The
chip may
not be a full production line model yet, or it was just a "modified" version
of another chip
for a specific customer to use ??

  Subject: [mailstation] Inventec


  This site has some info on TI Avigo PDA.
  The 6SI117 CPU is made by Inventec.
  http://www.datamath.org/Personal/Avigo10.htm

  Also from another page on that site:
  http://www.datamath.org/Featured_Companies.htm
  > Inventec Corporation was founded in Taiwan, on July 1, 1975
  > to produce simple calculators and telephone sets. In 1984
  > Inventec was Taiwan's largest manufacturer of calculators.
  > In the year 1986 an overseas manufacturing base was founded
  > in Penang, Malaysia to take advantage of competitive labour
  > rates. Inventec Micro-Electronics Corporation (IMC), one of

  > graphing calculators from the TI-73 to the TI-89 and the
  > data collection systems CBL2 and CBR. IMC was renamed IME
  > after Inventec group's reorganization in 1999.

  I have read a lot of web pages regarding Inventec, and I get the
  impression that they are a *HUGE* company. They make notebooks and
  pdas and phones for a lot of other companies. They also make
  the iPod for apple.

  Googling [inventec z80] finds this site:

http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:lao-3vhKzuoJ:electro-tech-online.com/vie
wtopic.php%3Ft%3D15332%26sid%3D0483339950207f7a33ddb214e4c43d2e+inventec+z80
&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox-a

  Well, that link will likely be garbled. It was
  top hit for that search, and I had to view it via
  googles cache, because page seems to be gone now.

  The pertinent part of page was a post asking for info:

  > I'm in search of data for an Inventec processor.
  > The chip came from a TI-83+ graphing calculator
  > as bares the text:
  >
  > Inventec
  > 6SI837 0A
  > Japan 0216EAI
  > PDARD
  > F0254ZAA
  >
  > ...if it helps, this is a Z80-enabled CISC processor.
  > I've tried googling and came up empty. Any data on pinouts,
  > or clocking data would be appreciated.

  There was no answer posted. Note the manufacturer,
  the similar part number, and most curiously the "PDARD".
  I believe the Avigo 6SI117 also says "PDARD", but I can't
  find a good picture of it right now. In case it didn't
  jump right out at you, the Avigo is a PDA, as in PDARD.

  I don't have any guess what the RD stands for, but
  RSDRD ends with RD, too. I have not been able to come
  up with any meaning for RSD as of yet.

  Googling for [rsdrd inventec] returns two sites
  that list 3SI176 as manufactured by "RSDRD".
  The line just above 3SI176 is for a 3SI0870A manufactured
  by "Inventec".
  http://www.digchip.com/distributors/parts/3s/parts_3s.php

  I think the brokers are just jumping to conclusion
  that the RSDRD is the manufacturer, because for some
  reason, they did not print "Inventec" on the package.

If you set them up to dial-in and send email, then you can use them as 
a word processor to a certain degree - simply compose your text in an 
email message, and [ save it as a draft | send it as email ] to your 
desktop computer.

What you said finally sunk in to my brain toda=
y.  I don't think we would
need the putchar or getchar routines at all, as =
long as we are not writing
an old-fashioned-user-interface style program.  =
(O-FUI????)  <lmao>

If you are writing an event-driven GUI style app, you =
don't ever 
do any input yourself.  The OS receives the input, and packages=
 up the 
keystrokes from the keyboard (and input from other devices) and
pa=
sses them to your program as *parameters* in calls to your apps
event-handl=
er.  You would never call getchar.

This is the format for the mailstations=
 event records:
     (who, signal, this, that)

"who" is the app number tha=
t the event is for.
"signal" is the event type (such as keydown, keyup, etc=
).
"this" and "that" are the data payload that go with the particular event=
.
In the case of key events, "this" is scancode, and "that" is ascii.

A ma=
ilstation app is basically an event handler.  The mailstation
OS passes the=
se parameters to your apps event handler:
     handleevent(who, state, sign=
al, this, that);

"state" is a single byte state variable that the OS keeps=
 track of
for your app, between calls to handleevent.  (handleevent returns=

this "state" on exit as the function result.)  
The other four parameters =
are the event.

I don't really know what these should be called.  I
named the "event type" =
field as "signal" in my notes.
There is a queue that the events and such ar=
e placed in.
At first I was calling it "msgQ", when I didn't have any 
idea=
 what the messages were.

When I realized some of them were keyboard input,=
 I
changed it to "eventQ".  But then I noticed some of the
items did not ma=
tch my idea of "event", such as signal #0d
which means "draw yourself".  Ma=
ny of the signals are what
I would call "commands" rather than "events".

T=
hese are the signals that I have figured out so far.
Some are just guesses,=
 based on what *seemed* to be
happening where I saw them used.  (I am quite=
 sure that
01 thru 0d are correct.)  These values are passed
to your apps "=
handleevent" function, in the "signal" param.

;; signals:
01  - init app
0=
2 - ???
03 - go prev
04 - go main
05 - timer
06 - keydown, top keyrow  (may=
be should call it buttondown???)
07 - keyup, top keyrow
08 - keydown, norma=

09 - keyup, normal key
0A - menu event???

Great detective work.

I think you had it right in the first place: looks like a garden
variety message queue. Having all events placed on the queue allows a
simple idle loop where your app is just a big switch case in which you
process the next message from the queue. Most GUI programs are
architected this way: your application is associated with a window
which is associated with a message queue. All mouse and keyboard
events typically go into the queue; the same for paint events, button
clicks, etc. It looks like init/cleanup (lifecycle) also go through
the event queue.

The reason for a message queue like this is typically to keep
interrupt latency low (post to queue and process messages on idle
and/or bottom half of interrupt handler, i.e. run only when it is
safe). It also facilitates cooperative multitasking since the "kernel"
can easily switch between processing the queue for one application to
another without disruption.

Come to think of it, what program isn't? ;-)

I typically call this state a "cookie" or "(execution) context." The
server/kernel/OS lets you register it with the system and it just
returns it to the client application as-is. I would guess it is fairly
easy to trade the cookie for a memory pointer which holds the rest of
the application's state (object oriented types would call this memory
"Self" or "This").

There are a few cross-compiler versions of small-C
that run under dos and output target code for various
8 bit cpus. Have to look around for one.

I bought a MS 100 (DET1 I think) a while back simply because I was
looking =
for the parts. (case, LCD, keyboard etc...)

What I had planned on doing wa=
s ripping out the main board and
replacing it with one of my own design.

B=
ut after finding out that this is a Z-80 based system (what I had
planned t=
o use), it'd be really nice to be able to use it as is.

So what *I* would =
like to do is re-blast the system to make it a
simple, single board compute=
r, with (to start) machine code entry,
then use that (plus a PC) to get it =
up to a system that could enter
regular Z-80 assembler, then compile and ru=
n.

(I guess connect it to a PC to blast the code to the MS and then boot
i=
t up, then I can use the keyboard from there)

I don't want fancy-schmancy =
email or anything.   Just run simple code.
 Although using the ports and mo=
dem later for stuff is certianly an
option later.

Anything close to that o=
ut there or am I better off ripping everything
out and putting my own guts =
in there??

Thanks, and thanks for the work done up til now, I'm pretty imp=

with the level of work done on this thing.

Yes, there is a target debugger in the files section.

Blast away!  But unless you are a reeeeeally good =
programmer, and
won't need to reflash a second (or 498th) time, you will wa=
nt to 
be careful to not erase the reflash code.  :-)

In the files section=
 there is a remote debugger (mailbug) which is
still a work in "progress" (=
ha ha ha).  The currently posted 
version (0.0.3, I think) will let you ins=
tall a program called
"sboot" into the mailstation codeflash.  After sboot =
is flashed,
mailbug will use it (sboot) to load the remote half of the debu=
gger,
called "mbug" into mailstation RAM.  Together, mailbug and mbug
give =
you access to the mailstation hardware.  You can load code
into the RAM and=
 execute it, or flash it somewhere in codeflash.

With sboot flashed into y=
our codeflash, you will need to keep
your mailstation connected to your PC =
(via parallel laplink cable),
because all sboot knows how to do is load mbu=
g over laplink.
You can test your code in ram, or flash it to high codeflas=
h
page, but you will need the PC and mailbug to execute it.

You could alwa=
ys overwrite sboot with a jump to your new code
after you've tested it, but=
 then, unless you leave some kind of
back door, you won't be able to flash =
any newer version of
your code.

I was kicking around various ideas on how =
a next version of sboot
would work, (in particular I wanted it to both be a=
ble to boot 
directly to your new code without PC attached, and still give =

mailbug access if PC was attached), when I figured out enough
about how th=
e mailstation apps work to write a simple app.

I wrote an app that just du=
mped the codeflash over the laplink.
Pretty cool!  (At least I thought so.)=
  The only problem was
I had to enter it via the mailstations hex editor.  =
Why not
use mailbug to load it, you may ask.  Because installing
sboot enta=
ils erasing the mailstation codeflash.  And you can't
dump it after it's er=
ased.  :-)

Mailbug, in addition to the remote debug type of functions,
has=
 a few functions that work with stock mailstation (read
serial number, refl=
ash code, load splash screen data).
I started to add function to catch the =
dump over laplink, 
but before I got it polished up, I decided a better 
id=
ea would be to just load a version of sboot as an app.  
I actually poked i=
n a shortened version of sboot, about 
150 bytes, with the hex editor.  It =
worked, sort of.  But 
entering with hex editor was kind of tedious.

Then =
I had a brainstorm!  Why not embed the app in the splash
screen data!!!  Th=
en I'd only need to type enough bytes
with hex editor (in the app space) to=
 jump to the splash screen!
That works, but there is still a bit of work to=
 do to get
mailbug to sync up with the "bootapp".

I got side-tracked from =
that a couple of months ago, when
I found an example showing how to control=
 the parallel port
from windows, (theoretically including XP).  So, for
the=
 last several weeks, I have been converting mailbug
to a win32 application.=
  Just about 3 days ago, I got 
this version to "talk to the port", but I'v=
e only tested
under 98 so far.  The dll is supposed to work with any 
versi=
on of windows, I just don't have NT, 2000, or XP.

There is still a whole l=
ot to do to get it working with all
the functionality of the DOS version.  =
Things like project
selection, and file selection were somewhat crude in la=
st 
version, but they use standard open dialogs now.  Yay.

Gee, you would have thought that somebody as big as HP would have 
figured =
out a way to make it work in BOTH directions.  It is great 
that they can g=
et photos now. But they can't send those photos !!!!

Unless HP comes out w=
ith a second unit that does both send and 
receive, I don't see this going =
very far ????

But then, that is my conclusion !!

What we REALLY need out =
there is an Upgrade to the Mailstation 350 
unit, (with all the new tech ad=
vances lately) which would do the 
email and pictures !!!  HP should partne=

unit........

There is something that does all that. It's called
msntv.Of course you have to put up with the Microsoft
tax, and allow Microsoft to scan your email, tv
viewing selections, and web useage logs for personal
information they sell to advertisers. 

  Compaq (now a part of HP, manufactured the IPAQ IA-1
and IA-2 Web terminals. these included a 56k modem,
monitor, sound, keyboard, and usb ports in a compact
standalone unit. The run a flash based version of
Windows CE and would allow a user to quickly connect
to MSN. A special version of the IA-1, known as the
Clipper, had similar capabilities but included a
10baseT ethernet port, used the BeIA (BEOS for
Internet Appliances) OS, and was not explicitly locked
to MSN. Clippers will work well with an internet
connection through a cable modem, but are somewhat
rare as Microsoft used it monopoly power to leverage
anti-competitive contracts that forced Compaq to
discontinue the Clipper.

You have a point there !!!

That would have to stay under the "Free" Linux license.

It could be an Open service for any ISP or email service.
The main problem is WHO would make it, and sell it,
and still get any income for it to make it profitable to
do that ???

There is a precendent here that a company can leverage.  The problem is ess=
entially where would a company get the income to be able to offer the servi=
ce AND remain profitable.  It all comes down to the market: if the customer=
 doesn't put in the dough, someone else must.  Yahoo places an advertisemen=
t in the message that it transmits.  Every click on the ad pays Yahoo $ (mi=
nd you, it's only a few cents, if that!).  In order to keep a service alive=
, a company needs a baseline:

    Hardware
        + air conditioning
    =
    + redundant hardware
        + back up power
        + data back up
   =
 Personel
        + technicians
        + programmers
        + management
=
        + (accountants)
        + "human" resources
    Facilities/Internal=
 Services
        + leases
        + taxes
        + utilities (water, powe=
r, phone, internet, gas)
        + janitorial
        + security (Hire-a-ba=
dge)
        + data banks/records
    External Services
        + tax consu=
lting
        + business insurance
        + liability insurance
        + =
[full timers] health insurance

I think it's pretty clear that a regular bu=
siness pays a load of money for a "simple" service.  BTW, "basement" servic=
es are usually frowned on by ISPs.

You

That

It

The

Your missing the point of that !!!

I would hope that a retailer would bring out the unit, just like DELL and
HP, and
other computer companies bring out products.  The difference would be that

unit would be able to setup on "any" ISP, just like a normal computer does.

I don't expect the ISP to give the email service for free !!!

It would be nice however to have some choice in email package prices, and
which
ISP you choose.

It is like the new HP unit that allows you to "Receive" pictures....that is
great, but
I know my Senior Citizen relatives, and they ALSO want to be able to SEND
pictures,
and be able to SEND and RECEIVE emails with their friends and relatives,
easily without
the complex knowledge of how to work a full computer.

HP would have made more money if they came out with a unit that allowed a
digital camera
to plug into the unit and upload and send pictures back.  Also a keyboard to
send emails with.

A mail unit that is Open to any ISP that would do EMails and pictures would
easily sell
out there to the General public.  There just needs to be some effort by a
retailer to bring
that item forward !!!!

  There is a precendent here that a company can leverage.  The problem is
essentially where would a company get the income to be able to offer the
service AND remain profitable.  It all comes down to the market: if the
customer doesn't put in the dough, someone else must.  Yahoo places an
advertisement in the message that it transmits.  Every click on the ad pays
Yahoo $ (mind you, it's only a few cents, if that!).  In order to keep a
service alive, a company needs a baseline:

      Hardware
         + air conditioning
         + redundant hardware
         + back up power
         + data back up
      Personel
         + technicians
         + programmers
         + management
         + (accountants)
         + "human" resources
      Facilities/Internal Services
         + leases
         + taxes
         + utilities (water, power, phone, internet, gas)
         + janitorial
         + security (Hire-a-badge)
         + data banks/records
      External Services
         + tax consulting
         + business insurance
         + liability insurance
         + [full timers] health insurance

  I think it's pretty clear that a regular business pays a load of money for
a "simple" service.  BTW, "basement" services are usually frowned on by
ISPs.

  You have a point there !!!

  That would have to stay under the "Free" Linux license.

  It could be an Open service for any ISP or email service.
  The main problem is WHO would make it, and sell it,
  and still get any income for it to make it profitable to
  do that ???

      They run a flash based version of
      Windows CE and would allow a user to quickly connect

      anti-competitive contracts that forced Compaq to
      discontinue the Clipper.

What you are looking for (the AMD PIC pc) was offered fairly recently
in th=
e United States by RadioShack. Unfortunately no one was willing
to subsidiz=
e what it cost to put together (and it ran Windows CE...),
so due to its un=
popularity I can't find it as being available anymore.
I think they were as=
king $300 for an underpowered PC that was locked
up tight and didn't even h=
ave an ethernet port. (Did offer modem & usb
which would meet your requirem=
ents.)

You can see the same device offered by ISPs in several other countr=
ies
as listed here:

http://www.amd.com/us-en/ConnectivitySolutions/Product=
Information/0,,50_2330_12264_13469,00.html

More information is available a=
t the product's site here:

A linux web appliance.... There have been many
attempts to retrofit linux to the old web appliances.
There are several companies that make thin client
boxes that run linux, but they dont have the marketing
clout of MS. They are usually aimed at vertical
markets. http://www.linuxdevices.com can be searched
for these "thin client" or "Web Terminal"

Yes.  Wh=
en mbug starts, it banks page #01 of RAM
into slot4000, so unless you chang=
e it, it should
still be there.  

Mbug does not use this for anything itse=
lf, it just
puts it there as a convenience.  

The mailstation divides the =
64 kByte z80 address space 
into four 16 KByte regions, which I have been c=
alling 
slot0000, slot4000, slot8000, and slotC000.

The pages of ram, code=
flash, and dataflash are also
16 KBytes.  The mailstation has 128 KBytes of=
 ram,
ram pg #00 thru ram pg #07.

Slot0000 is always codeflash pg #00, and=
 slotC000 is
always ram pg #00

Mailbug command "6" will display the curren=
t inhabitants 
of slot4000 and slot8000, the two "bankable slots".

I have changed the membership for this group.

It may not help the amount o=
f SPAM, but it may be of use.

The amount of messages passing thru this gro=
up has all but stopped.

I'll try this for a while and see if it helps.

Thank you.

Well... I joined because I saw a Mailstation at the Thrift Store, but
didn't buy it.  I wanted to learn more before trying to hack one.

I second that thanks.

While I'm mostly a lurker around here and yet to have picked up a mailstation, 
i do appreciate the change in the rules.

( i do have a WP-2 if that counts :) )

If they want to come in, that will need a new email=

Hello all,

Warning: rambling ahead.

I have been clearing out stuff in my =
shop and have found the two
mailstations I hacked a few years ago.

My firs=
t thought was to give this units away to someone.

My second thought was to=
 re-engineer these units in someway.

Plastic cases are a problem for one o=
ff projects.

The mailstation is old technology and I would like to bring i=
t up to a
more recent processor.

The LCD display and keyboard are as good =
as any.

The builtin battery pack is very usefull.

The modem is a waste. I=
 am sure people in this group will look for a
hotspot before using a modem.=


So, my thought is desiging a card that would replace the main board in
th=
e mailstation.

[ Idea 1 ]

A full 32-bit cpu with a couple of megs of memo=
ry (flash/ram), an
ethernet interface would be nice, but we would be talkin=
g about a
$100/$200+ retrofit. 

Someone to layout the board, get them manu=
factured, put parts on them.

[ Idea 2 ]

A 32 bit single chip cpu with eno=
ugh memory would make a reasonable
development platform.

Maybe one of the =
larger single chip cpus for NXP.

Has anyhone measured out the main board i=
n the MS ?

The back panel has only a few openings but it may be enough.

A=
dd a compact flash for an 802.11 interface, an SPI interface for SD
cards.
=

[ Idea 3 ]

Finding a low cost cpu board that we can build a carrier to pl=
ug it
into the MS plastic.

Ok, what do you think.

Some summer project to =
keep us from mowing the lawn :-).

don

The mailstation case and keyboard are not worth saving.

One thought is to start with a TRS-80 Model 100 or Tandy 102 case.
Much more room to work. Has a built-in 4 AA battery holder.

I think a MS display would fit in there.

The keyboard is much better than the MS's

If the CPU is fast enough, you could run VirtualT and have a
supercharged Model 100 :-)

I will donate a case and KB if you design a PCB.

As far as CPU I would go for low power, long battery life.

-- John.

I have a couple of MS's that I thought of doing something similar. I 
wasn't able to find out how to drive the LCD with another processor. I 
decoded the keyboard and was able to make a functional serial terminal 
by using a different display. But my alternate display didn't fit the 
case at all. I used a Mega32 AVR microcontroller to drive the LCD and 
read the keyboard. It had more than enough power to act as a serial 
terminal...

Anyone have success trying to drive the LCD?

IMO these are desirable as is. All we need are solid methods to

If you want a WiFi computer, a laptop is now so cheap it isn't worth

My 2 cents:
You have to find something that is worthwhile to be sold to the general
public or else it is NOT going to
be built in a Mass big enough to get the price down to reasonable !!

The Mailstation concept is still doable !!!  A lot of people out there do
not have a computer, do not understand
how a computer runs, and do not want to put up with the hassles of owning
and maintaining one. This especially
goes for the Senior Citizens in this country.
BUT THEY STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE WORLD !!!

I have set up several Mailstations for some of my Senior relatives, and
although they were leery to use it, they
now don't know how they would survive without it.  The world has gone from
written letters to electronic ones, and
the electronic ones are there is minutes.

The Mailstation just needs to be updated, and allowed to be used on ANY
email server unit. This would allow
the user to then search and find the best service for them and connect the
unit to it.

The new unit should be patterned after the Model 350, which allows the
downloading of pictures and larger
emails.  Since memory has come a long way since the Mailstation's inception,
it is now efficient to include
larger memory in the unit.

Some of the faster, laptop CPU's would work with their lower power
consumption.  Even a older Pentium chip
would still be faster than what the original Mailstation had in it.

Biggest problem would be watching to not step on any patents that still
might be used in the device.

The option of a plug-in WIFI card is a good one, let the option slot take
either a Modem, WIFI, or Ethernet
plug in card. That way whichever service is going to be used can be
accommodated easily and without having to
load all that extra circuitry into the unit and not use it. That would also
keep the cost down for the unit.

Just my thoughts,
Wayne

IIRC one or more of these already has a wireless modem (not WiFi though).

Your thinking of the Model 350. This has a 900 Mhz. wireless connection to
it's
plug-in modem unit, so the Model 350 can be used remotely in the room and
not
have to be used where the telephone line plugs in.  It is not compatible
with
the 2 Gig WIFI stuff.  And changing the wireless unit out in the Model 350
would
mean that you would have to get the unit type accepted again by the FCC.

Easiest way is to use an "Option slot" for these. That way it would take
anyone's
unit, (Which is already FCC type accepted), and you would not have to mess
around
with it.  It would also keep the cost down by not requiring each unit to
have all three
hookup cards, (WIFI, Ethernet, Modem) inside the main unit.  I don't see any
situation
where you would be using more than one connection type at one time ??

You could go with the Linux software, since it is considered "Freeware", and
you would
not have to pay Microsoft any royalties for anything.  But it would require
more time
compiling an Operating system for this specific use.  Actually, Linux uses
less space
to run than Windows does, and works with more stuff.  The Boot up Kernel can
be "Edited"
so as to just allow it to install and access only the drivers and devices
that you needed it too.
Unlike Windows, which loads everything under the sun on your system. A lot
of which is
not needed for your specific applications.  Linux will run well with even a
386 cpu and small memory.

The Sendmail program is a tried and true mail program for Linux. There are
lots of other
programs for specific uses available for "Free" for Linux at the CPAN web
site.

  Does anybody know where I might be able to get a manual for a Mailstation
100/150 unit.   I am putting one on line for a "Senior", and I need to get
them some sort of Operator's manual.

  Thanks,

  Wayne

I was led to understand that there was an active and moderated 
project to hack these devices, but have seen no posts here (about 
anything).  "moved home" is an expression I used to suggest that the 
project may no longer be hosted here but somewhere else instead.

Thank You for the defi=
nation, never heard it said that way before.

This is one "home" for inform=
ation about mailstation.

The other is: http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin=
/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl

Scroll down to mailstation.

But to let you know=
, the "development" of mailstation software stopped
awhile ago.

There is n=
ot enough information to get anything really done.

The time required to re=
verse enginner the mailstation has slowed to a
crawl and has now stopped.

=
So, if you have the time and disere to forge on ahead, please ask any
quest=
ions about what you find here and on the Linux-hacker site.

Good Luck and =
have fun.

don

Thanks everyone, this is exactly what I was looking for.........

I have been trying to find some time to play with the Linux Internet/email
server
we own, and try to see if I can set it up on one of the spare netcards that
I can put in
it and then tell it is the DNS address of the mailstation units.  Then try
to see if
I can get a couple of these units I have to change over to another usable
address.

I have two Model 350's that I can't get to work on Earthlink's system.  One
has had the
memory erased (whoops), and the other seems to work but Earthlink just can't
get it to
recognize their setup message and get it to change it's default address to
work.  It seems
to send and receive correctly, but just won't recognize the setup messages.

Also, something most people are not aware of.  There is an account set up on
Earthlink for
every mailstation serial number out there.  This is so the mailstation can
log into the SMTP
server and get the setup message to change over to the account that is being
setup for the
customer.

Providing the correct network information is in the mailstation programming,
it will call up
Earthlink and get whatever is in that serial number account.  Unfortunately
you cannot send
anything to those accounts from outside of Earthlink.  But it does let you
see if the unit is
working !!  If I remember correctly there was an entry on this BBS that told
you how to figure
out what the password was so you could log in to that account from a regular
computer to see
if the mailstation found anything.

Most of the technical stuff on the mailstations is being done from India.  I
talked and worked with
a very knowledgeable tech over there that helped me get a Model 350 working,
but we were still unable
to get the other one to work.   The 350's evidently take a different type of
setup message than the
other models.

Wayne

I for one say thanks, we get enough of that stuff all day.
Heard today that they put away on of the biggest Spammers this week.
About half the spam disappeared from my email this week !!!!
Hope they get the others, especially the ones that do falsified
return IP addresses (spoofed)

thanks,
wayne

mory in half ( from 500 messages to 
maybe 100) and charge less per month ?=
??

But it provides some great competition !!

Hiya folks.  I got a Mailstation a few years ago, but at the time, 
develop=
ment was still barely in the hardware discovery phase, with no 
hope in sig=
ht of ever running homebrew code or reflashing the 
device.  I figured all =
efforts were about dead, and stopped keeping 
up with it.  I also messed ar=
ound with the thing using my own POP 
account for a bit, but then got tired=
 of it altogether and stashed it 
away.

Well I got to thinking about a pro=
ject I'm planning involving a 
microcontroller and graphical LCD, and happe=
ned to remember having 
the Mailstation stashed away, so I dug it back out =
to muck around 
with, deciding to see what people have been up to since I l=
ast 
checked.

Quite a bit, apparently!  Not only do they know a lot about =
the 
components and memory layout and such, but apparently there's a 
coupl=
e different methods of running homebrew code.  Pretty great work 
there, gu=
ys.

I'm not keen on totally reflashing my MS at this point though, 
partia=
lly cause I don't want to risk messing it up with no hopes of 
reflashing i=
t due to the tiny board components, so I decided to try 
using the hex edit=
or functionality to enter code manually.  I'm a bit 
confused on how to use=
 it, however.

For the record, I have an old black DET1, and a demo unit at=
 that.  
Following the instructions in the spew.txt, I got to the hex viewe=
r.  
It then says in order to enter hex edit mode, you use "G710304x", 
alo=
ng with control-s to edit.  A few things about this, though:

- Firstly, ho=
w does the hex editor addressing work in order for me to 
know what device/=
page/sector/whatever of ram/codeflash/dataflash?

- I noticed that unless I=
 use the "G710304x" first, I can't edit at 
all.  Why is this?  And is the =
"x" significant?  I found that even if 
I put an x after a normal address (=
0000 for example), I still can't 
edit without using that particular addres=
s above beforehand.

- Is it even possible for me to modify ram from there?=
  It'd be nice 
if I could enter code there to test without updating the fl=
ash over 
and over.  And in the event that you can enter code into the ram =
from 
the hex editor, does it still exist once the MS starts up?

- Less im=
portantly, I don't have a control key.  I found simply 
pressing "s" enters=
 and exits edit mode, though.  I guess it makes no 
difference, but thought=
 it worth mentioning.


I think that's all I meant to ask.  At first, I tho=
ught I might just 
carefully remove the guts (storing'em away just in case)=
 and reuse 
the keyboard and LCD along with something like an 8052 variant,=
 but 
if there's some chance I can put my own code into the thing and get 
=
some functionality out of what's already there, that'd be pretty 
cool.  I =
think I read elsewhere here that it has like 9 or 10 pages 
of flash free, =
so that's quite a bit for development purposes.  128k 
of ram is pretty dec=
ent, too.

Oh also, in the Yahoo icon apps, what return address would I jum=
p to 
in order to get back to the menu?  Preferably the application menu, 
=
but either is fine.  The spew.txt example jumps to 0000, which 
apparently =
resets the device.

First off your using one of the first Mailstations ever made, and it =

does not have a lot of ROM or RAM in it.  The Hex editor "is" editing 
the=
 entire memory in the unit !!!  If I remember there is NO flash 
memory in =
that unit.

The code that you put in is the "Password" to get into the Hex =
editor 
as per what the manufacturer picked for that unit. That is why it i=
s 
that particular code and nothing else !!

Good luck with your project !!=

Naw it's pretty much the standard hardware =
as anyone elses of this 
model.  The only thing different about it being a =
display model that 
I'm aware of is that I can specify my own POP and SMTP =
servers in the 
settings.  I double-checked all the chips before, it's got =
the same 
128KB EPROM, 512KB EEPROM, 1MB Flash, and 128KB SRAM that I've se=
en 
others list as their models having.

Plus I've flashed some test code i=
n with the "Yahoo icon" method to 
see if it'd work, and it saves it.

Anyh=
oo if that's really just a code and not some particular memory 
location, t=
hen it still leaves me wondering how to use the hex 
editor.  I initially t=
hought it was only editing code, but then I 
found that one can also access=
 their emails from here as well, so I 
really have no idea which chips I'm =
accessing at any particular 
location.

I'm also curious if someone could g=
ive me the entire series of 
identifier bytes that belong to one of the cus=
tom apps.  I'd kind of 
like to figure out the icon format if possible, eve=
n though I'm sure 
others have tried and might have had more skill at figur=
ing it out 
than me.  I've messed with my share of graphics data for other =
stuff 
though so I thought I'd like to take a look just in case.  Even more=
 
helpful along with that data would also be an image of the icon 
itself t=
o compare against.

It's just a back do=
or they left, not a real address.  

The first thing you get to is just a h=
ex-viewer.  
The viewer has a hidden command "^s" that puts you 
in edit mo=
de, but only if the edit-mode has been 
enabled.  The menu says ^s, but you=
 are right, 
just s works, too.  By the way, the ctrl key is 
labeled "Fn".=


When you enter <ctrl-s>  (or just <s>), the viewer 
checks a flag to see =
if you are allowed to edit, and 
if so, kicks you over to edit mode.  If yo=
u are
not allowed to edit, you just stay in viewer mode.

The only way to g=
et that flag set is to first enter 
"go" mode, where there is a hidden comm=
and "x".  
Whenever you feed an "x" to go mode, it will check 
the value in=
 the address buffer.  If that buffer 
does not have the value "710304", the=
 "x" command 
does nothing.

But if the secret number is in that buffer 
(d=
isplayed in middle of screen), then it sets the 
edit-enable flag.  Bet the=
y thought no one would 
ever figure *that* out!  ;^)

After setting flag, y=
ou need to go back to viewer 
mode.  Easiest way to get back is with <back>=
 key.  
If you hit enter instead, it will try to put you 
at an address way=
 past the end of the dataflash.  
I think it rounds down to the highest pos=
sible 
address.  Then you will need to "go" again, to 
get to where you wan=
t to edit.  If you leave with 
<back> it will leave you pointing to whateve=
r 
sector you were previously viewing.

If you have successfully set the ed=
it-enable 
flag, you can now toggle between editor and viewer 
with ^s (I c=
an't remember if plain <s> works to 
leave edit mode).  You have to leave e=
dit mode 
to move to another sector, but you only need to 
set the enable f=
lag once.

This viewer/editor only works with the dataflash.

; Hello World, as a mailstation app.

 never been tested, mainly

orrectly

That's useful to know, I always=

Do we know how much of the dataflash =
can be used for our own 
purposes?  Or more to the point, is anything in th=
ere truly vital to 
the functionality of the MS?  Could one "break" the MS =
by writing 
junk data to a particular place?  If so, I would assume one cou=
ld 
just reset the MS and that'd fix it, but I dunno what all a reset 
actu=
ally performs.

In a related question, how much of the ram is important?  I=
s any of 
it used for servicing interrupt(s) and such, with the risk of 
cr=
ashing it if one started using particular pages?

I still don't know what t=
he interrupt routines of the MS are even 
doing though, or what mode it run=
s in or any of that, or as to 
whether one could write their own routines f=
or handling them.

I mostly want to just load stuff in via the parallel por=
t into a 
section of ram, to avoid constant rewriting to the dataflash.  I =

figure one could do this fairly easily without erasing all the 
existing c=
odeflash like mailbug seems to do.  I also don't see why it 
wouldn't be po=
ssible at this point to totally commandeer the hardware 
away from the main=
 MS code, using the ram and such for our own 
purposes and just never retur=
ning to the MS code.  If interrupts were 
a problem, one could probably jus=
t disable them (well, except NMI, 
assuming it's used) and manually strobe =
for keyboard input.

Out of curiosity, what's the 128KB EPROM for, when ass=
umedly the code 
is all in the 1MB of flash?  

Anyway I have lots of quest=
ions, not sure how many have been answered 
somewhere that I haven't notice=
d, but hopefully I'm not being a 
nuisance.  hehe

And thanks for the help =
so far!

I had recreated the calculator icon in 1-bit-per-pixel format and was 
=
searching through the dumped flash in the Files section to see if I 
could =
match it up to something that might have some icon header that 
I could mak=

built-in apps and w=
hether it would have even helped to find the 
icon.  So thanks for the stru=
cture and icon info!

I compiled with as80 (after fixing some of the assemb=

the beginning there, which it complained about them being =
uppercase) 
and manually entered it into the MS via the hex editor.  A 721 =
byte 
file ends up being a little longer to type in that one might think,

but not too bad.  I was able to run the app, got a chuckle from the 
image =
it displayed, but noticed there was a problem with the tab's 
text.  It was=
 just "! ..." instead of "Hello world!!!".  I realized 
that I didn't put a=
 carriage return after the very last line in the 
assembly file, which resu=

extra bytes onto the end in the hex ed=

the Back button let me exit and such, so the c=

the hex I typed 
in, and am fairly sure I didn't mistype anything.  Unless =
you spot 
anything with the code that could be the issue, I might double-ch=

my typing once more when it's not so late.

I think dataflash pages 0 thru 7 are available for apps.

Pages 8 thru 63 of the dataflash are used by the mailstation 
code, fo=
r storing email, settings, etc.

Running the flash test will erase almost everything in dataflash,
=
except the serial number, IIRC.  My hunch is you could fix 
anything you br=
eak by running flash test.

Darn go=
od question!  We don't really know what pages of the
RAM might be unused.  =
I think that all of the RAM used by
int's is in RAM page 0 (which is always=
 found in slotC000).

The=
re are int's for keyboard, modem, caller ID, some timers,
and prob the RTC.=
  

Both INT & NMI are vectored to service routine in codeflash,
so to writ=
e your own, you would need to modify codeflash.
IOW, if you are writting an=
 app that runs from dataflash,
you would just let mailstation handle its in=
terrupts.  But your 
app can set timers, and then receive timer events.  I'=
m
pretty sure that when your app is active, it will get
keyboard and modem =
events by default.

The newest version that I was=
 working on last fall (which
got pushed onto back burner, and is unfortunat=
ely still there)
will work without erasing any of the codeflash.  You will
=
have to edit about 10 bytes or so of the dataflash by
hand (with the mailst=
ation's native hex editor).

Absolutely!    And you could just reboot the mails=
tation 
to exit your app.  (Jump to #0000)

I don't see any problem wi=
th letting the mailstation
handle the interupts either, and using the built=
 in keyboard
routines.  

I don't know yet just how to get an app in the me=
nu, 
except by putting it into the dataflash, but for
testing purposes, you=
 could run it from RAM using mailbug.

It h=

for the mode=
m.

AFAICR, there really hasn't been *any* frequently asked questi=

in this group!  The documentation has not really been organized
very wel=
l.  There is some in the file section, some in msg archive,
and some on the=

No problem!

I do intend to resurect mailbug sometime "real soon now", =
but
even if I worked full time on it, it might take a week or two
just to r=
emember where I was at last fall.

Yeah, by default as80 wants lower case only.  I add the -i switch

I think you've just answered=
 a question I had.  When perusing the I-
Appliance board when I first got b=
ack into this, I found the very 
useful ports list for the MS, which listed=
 the codeflash as having 64 
pages, and the dataflash as 32 pages.  In anot=
her post, I found 
somebody pointing out that the smaller chip had less pos=
sible write 
cycles than the larger one, which didn't make any sense to use=
 it as 
the dataflash since it was the one getting written to all the time.=
  
You seem to be confirming that the smaller 512KB chip is indeed 
codefla=
sh, with the larger 1MB chip being dataflash.  Correct?

I'm assuming the timers are set/triggered via =
MS code?  In the ports 
list, "p3.4 =3D increment time16" makes me think th=
at on every 
increment of some time value (16th of a second?) the interrupt=
 gets 
triggered, from which the MS interrupt code keeps track of these 
in=
crements, and checks to see if any software timers were set/
triggered.

That =

it.  I know=

Last fall I had my head buried in the workings of th=

into a ram/flash cartridge, though the add-on unfortunately never got=
 
finished due to the seeming jungle of wires required to assemble it.

lol no such luck on nudie pics.  Let's just say that I'm assuming the

When using your as80 command-line options, I al=
so got 713 bytes.  But 
when I run the program now, it just says "+V" inste=
ad of the former 
"! ..."

So I'm not really sure what could be the problem=
, unless it's 
switching pages during the tab drawing routine.  I wouldn't =
think so, 
but it's all that comes to mind.

I think it's using the user's sess=

thing in the url, because it's different =
when I go to get it.  It's 
even different than it was for me a few minutes=

I decided to make a new topic with just a bunch of various questions, 
and =
hopefully it'll be easier for folks to find in a search.  HERE 
GOES~


- W=
hat does "XTND: On" mean exactly in the top right corner of the 
options sc=
reen?

- From my understanding, the demo units of the DET1 allowed you to 
=
type in your own POP/SMTP servers.  Does this mean the codeflash 
between a=
 demo unit and standard unit are different, or is it simply 
detecting some=
 hardware aspect and locking out the feature from 
standard units?  If the =
code is indeed different, has it ever been 
dumped?  If not/so, are the dum=
ps in the Files section from a 
standard unit?  

My own demo unit version =
seems to be 3.03a, which makes me think that 
the code is in fact different=
, and that it hasn't been dumped (or at 
least not uploaded), but I wanted =
to verify both things.

And related to this, I assume it would be possible =
to take a dump 
from a demo unit and put it on a standard unit, so that one=
 could 
change the POP/SMTP servers.  Not that it matters much, I don't use=
 
the modem functionality of the MS, but I'm curious nonetheless.


- Do we=
 know what all triggers NMI interrupts?

- Do we know how exactly to write =
into the codeflash and/or dataflash 
via software?  Apparently the Mailstat=
ion can do it, so I'm only left 
to assume one can either use the routines =
already there, or someone 
has possibly figured out how to do it from scrat=
ch.  

- How is a codeflash update triggered from the parallel port?

- How=
 does the port "P2C =3D printer data direction" work?  And related 
to that=
:  once set as inputs, does one still need to write 1's to the 
data port i=
n order to read from it properly?

- Did we ever find out if there was a de=
vice 6?  There seems to be a 
pin for it on the processor pinout list.  If =
nothing's attached, it 
could be kind of useful for adding ones own hardwar=
e.  Assuming one 
could even solder to the tiny pins on the board!  


I th=
ought I had more questions, but they seem to have escaped me at 
the moment=
.  But this is enough for now!

Usually on devices like this I believe power-off is what triggers NMI.
This gives a small window to prepare for loss of power.

My take on this is that there must be a pin which puts the port into a
quas=
i serial I/O mode, and this is how the device is reflashed.

No, =
I was just typing when I should have been sleeping (or
maybe I *was* asleep=
???).

Make that "pages 8 thru 31 of the dataflash are used by the
mailstat=
ion..."

The codeflash is 64 16k pages, and the dataflash 32 16k pages.

Th=
e dataflash is eraseable in 256 byte sectors, while
the codeflash is erased=
 in 64K byte sectors.

I'm going to answer=
 my own question with a bit of a "duh", because I 
forgot that most modern =
Flash memory can be programmed in-system with 
series of standard read/writ=
e command sequences.  I normally do all 
the ones I work with in a programm=
er, though I remembered this 
helpful little fact while reading over a data=
sheet for a different 
eeprom, which prompted me to look at the sheet for t=
he Mailstation's 
dataflash (28SF040).  It appears even simpler to do than =
some.  Only 
tricky part is that you'd have to write to the appropriate 
Ma=
ilstation port to change the dataflash page (in whichever device 
slot you =
were using) to set the upper address pins (A14-18), then 
separately set A0=
-13 to the lower dataflash address during a normal 
read/write z80 command,=
 while making sure to still set A14-15 from 
there appropriately to make su=
re you were writing to the correct 16k 
Mailstation slot (aka to the eeprom=
).

Only difference I see from a quick glance at the codeflash is that it 
=
has some longer command sequences, and of course a different sector 
size.
=

Anyhoo, as I said, that may be a bit of a "duh" to many folks I'm 
sure, b=
ut maybe it'll be useful info to somebody else.  Obviously one 
shouldn't s=
till need the MS's flash writing routines if you were 
going to totally rep=
lace its data/codeflash.

Hi, all,

I spotted a working mailstation in a thrift store the other day for
$10 but didn't buy it.  From inspecting it, it looks like it was last
used in 2002, from the weather/TV listings in the Flash.

So how does $10 sound?  About right?  Really cheap?  Way too much?

Thanks,

-ethan

I decided to dump my codeflash since I have a DET1 demo unit and 
haven't s=
een anyone else dump the code from one, so I thought I'd 
post both the Win=
dows C++ app I wrote to fetch it on the PC side 
(based around Cyrano Jones=
' unit_tribbles) as well as my actual 
codeflash dump (v3.03a).  You need h=
is spew.txt Yahoo app to dump the 
data to the PC, mind you.

I plan to mod=
ify the spew.txt to let me dump the dataflash too, out 
of curiosity.

Anyh=
oo, here's just the C file for anyone that wants to check it out 
here:



=
/*	
 *	Maildump.cpp
 *	------------
 *	
 *	This should dump your Mailstatio=
n's codeflash, in combination
 *	with Cyrano Jones' "spew.txt" app for the =
Mailstation, and 
 *	a laplink cable of course.
 *
 *	Basic use would be as=
 follows:
 *	1.) connect laplink cable to MS and PC
 *	2.) turn on MS
 *	3.=
) run maildump on PC
 *	4.) run spew on MS
 *
 *	The MS should be on first =
to ensure parallel port signals are
 *	reset, otherwise your dump could be =
bad.  If you think you 
 *	did get a bad dump, it wouldn't hurt to turn the=
 MS off and
 *	on again, waiting for the main menu to show up, just to make=

 *	sure it resets itself before you start listening for data.
 *
 *	The du=
mp should be 1,048,576 bytes (1MB), and named "ms.bin",
 *	which is automat=
ically overwritten everytime you run the
 *	program.
 *
 *	This is based ar=
ound Cyrano Jones' unit_tribbles in Pascal, 
 *	but written to work under W=
indows (tested under XP) thanks
 *	to inpout32.dll, which doesn't require a=
 separate driver
 *	to interface with I/O ports.  It's pretty useful!
 * 
 =
*	Spew.txt can be gotten from the Yahoo Mailstation group's file
 *	section=
: 
 *	http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/files/Mailbug/
 *

I do recall a Yahoo icon somewhere in the menus, so that makes sense.
Mostly, I didn't want to buy the "wrong" one and find out - "oh...
_that_ one... there's no way to explore the innards on _that_ model".
:-/

I'll go back this week and see if it's still there.

Thanks for the quick answers.

Going by spew.txt, changing the data at 0x20000 can let you add new 
app en=
tries to the MS.  You do so by changing the first digit of this 
series of =
bytes:

02 00 02 00 01 00 01 5e   1c 18 01 01 01 20 a7 19

Well this works =
fine for one or two extra apps.  But upon trying to 
add a third app, I ran=
 across a problem.  I get three icons, but my 
third icon is now the same a=
s my first one (on mine this is the Hello 
World app).  And running this th=
ird one doesn't work, it simply 
returns to the main menu.  The first two a=
pps run fine though.

Has anyone deciphered this series of bytes to know wh=
at they're for?  
Or is there the possibility that the MS just simply can't=
 handle more 
than 2 apps?

I forgot to mention that if you clear out all the bytes except the 
first o=
ne where you specify your number of apps, all the app icons 
end up the sam=
e (your first app's), and none of them will execute 
(aka just returning to=
 the main menu).  Could be a piece to the 
puzzle.

an 2 apps?

I was looking into my notes on the app directory (pg #08), 
and=
 I found out a bit more since I wrote the instructions 
in "spew.asm" file.=
  

The first 4 bytes in page #08 are a header, where the 
first byte is a =
count of the number of apps in dataflash.  
After the 4 byte header, there =
are six byte records, one 
for each loaded app.  I don't know what all the =
bytes 
mean, but the second byte is the dataflash page number 
where you pu=
t the app, and the 6th byte is an app number. 

I think there is a max of 5=
 extra apps. 

App number prob should be at least #18, but I don't know 
fo=
r sure.  I don't know what would happen if you used the 
number of some oth=
er app (built in apps have numbers, too).  

I think the highest the app nu=
mber is allowed to be is #1D, 
or maybe #1E.  (there is an internal app tab=
le with 30 rows,
but I don't remember right now if the first is app 00 or 0=
1.)

Going by the data you posted, the first dataflash app is
#18, so I am =
gonna guess that the last internal app is #17.
AFAICT, just about every dif=
ferent screen type is a 
different "app", even if the screens seem to be pa=
rt of
what you would normally call the same "app".

; Use the set timer function from ms firmware

      pop  hl
      pop  hl

; Then in your=
 event handler, look for events with sig =3D #05, 
; they should arrive eve=
ry half second.


There are 10 timers that can be set at same time, but 
as=
 far as I can see, each app can only use one, because 
they would all send =
the same event (sig =3D #05).  It
would be hard to distinguish between two =
timers, if 
you did set two.

I used the notation "time16" to distinguish a=
 16 bit 
timebase from another 32 bit timebase (which I called 
"time32", o=
ddly enough).  The above 10 timers are in 
addition to both time16 and time=
32.

Time32 is advanced by 16 every keyscan interrupt.  
Each of the 10 tim=
ers is also incremented by the same 
keyscan interrupt.  I was wondering wh=
y time32 would 
count by 16's, and I thought maybe I figured it out.  
1/60=
 =3D .0166666, so I thought that maybe this was a 
60hz interrupt, with clo=
se to 16 ms period.

But now I see that the timers are advanced by just 1, =

and if the units on the timers are milliseconds (I 
think I verified this?=
??), then there must be 
interrupt every milisecond.

I spent=
 some time over weekend looking over my files 
and trying to refresh my mem=
ory.  I found a version 0.0.4 
which I don't know is usable or not, and a 0=
.0.5 (windows 
version), which is definitely not done. 

I remember I had t=
o uninstall the dos version of freepascal 
(or at least I thought I needed =
to) to get the windows 
version working.  I never got the windows version w=
orking, 
but instead got a related IDE (Lazarus) working.  Lazarus 
is a cr=
oss-platform (win, linux, mac) open-source clone 
of Borland's Delphi.

I h=
ave never used Delphi (or Lazarus) before, so I guess 
you know what soaked=
 up all my time last fall!  :-)

I was getting tired of waiting for the pro=
ject to rebuild, 
and the docs said the long wait was due to the fact they =

were using the gnu linker.

They had a developer version (as opposed to la=
st stable 
release) that had a much faster linker, and I tried to 
get it g=
oing, but I never got it to work with a 
particular widget (color text) tha=
t I really needed.

About there is where I stopped work on it, for various =

other reasons (Partly 'coz I was also playing with 
AVR's at the time).
 
=

hardware, and I just co=

a couple months ago, and all these damn boxes 
look the same!!!

Yeah, I think the last page of the codeflash is unus=

at least in 2.22r, 2.53yr & 2.54.  Not real sure about 
the others, but=
 I'll bet it's empty in all, coz the

I think the earlier 2.xx models actually have *more*

I keep seeing references to fu=
nctions from the MS firmware, yet the 
only list I've ever seen (on I-Appli=
ance) is a half-completed one 
from page 1 of the codeflash (the jump table=
 for mostly the flash

of 
various useful functions (and hopefully with their required

After looking back o=
ver your Hello World app, I came to realize why 
exactly the initial jump i=
n the icon header was called 
"eventhandler", since it's obviously called e=

happens, not just to start the app.  It seems rather we=

My first compilable language was =
Turbo Pascal, which I learned the 
ins and outs of by pouring over the exce=
llent built-in help.  I've 
never found another language since that made it=
 so easy to learn just 
with the stuff they included.  I never had Turbo C =
until long after I 
learned C, but I remember C never came as easy to me as=
 Pascal had.

I messed with FreePascal once because I was pleased to see th=
e 
language revived (having never really used Delphi or ever having any 
re=
al urge to).  But it's just not the same when I can't write 
plain'ol DOS a=
pps.

The cartridge aspect I did complete, using a flash eeprom to r=
eplace 
the code rom on a real cartridge (as many others have done).  The 
=
thing about NES carts though is that there's tons of variations, 
mostly di=
fferent takes on paging different sections of code and 
graphics, so withou=
t adding some real brains like an FPGA to handle 
all the varieties, you en=
d up basically building a board that might 
support a couple different cart=
ridge types, and you're limited to the 
games that would run on those.  I t=
hink there have been a couple of 
hardcore guys that have made almost truly=
 universal flash carts 
though.

In some cases you can modify the original =
rom images to run on a cart 
even if it was designed for a different type. =
 While most cartridges 
had two separate rom chips, one for code and one fo=
r character data 
(aka tiles/sprites), I chose to use a cartridge type that=
 uses SRAM 
in place of character rom, and uses a simple paging mechanism f=
or the 
code rom.  This worked natively for various games, but for others 
=
that wanted an actual character rom chip, I could write a loader into 
the =
rom code which ran before the game did, copy the character rom 
data from s=
omewhere in the code rom into the SRAM in the cart, then 
jump back to the =
original starting point for the game.  

The board I was making would have =
implemented basically a BIOS into 
the NES, starting up to that instead of =
running whatever cartridge 
might be inside.  From there I would have been =
able to transfer code 
to a ram cart, update the flash in my current cart, =
and be able to 
disable all this to switch control over to the cartridge it=
self.  
That's where the complexity came in, due to the various signals I h=
ad 
to intercept to/from the cartridge.  I probably could just use 
somebod=
y like ExpressPCB to make a board for me to avoid soldering 
all the wires,=
 but I need to at least test the design one day.

Also, as for transferring=
 code to the NES, I found that one can get 
by with using a controller port=
, and get a decent 4-5KB/s.  Perfectly 
fine for the size of data I'd be de=
aling with, to avoid further 
complexity of adding in some other form of tr=
ansfer.

After dumping the dataflash, there se=
ems to be a ton of it not used.  
I think the really only important parts a=
re the last two sectors, one 
of which contains the serial number, and the =
other some unknown 
bytes.  Other than that, it mostly seems to be third-pa=
rty apps at 
the top of it all, and then your email somewhere around the mi=
ddle.  
Since email is kind of unnecessary now, I don't see why one couldn'=
t 
use that entire area for other storage, assuming the MS never writes 
an=
ything in there at some other time.

I also had a thought in regards to sim=
ply using it as a word 
processor.  One could still type stuff as emails, b=
ut then write a 
little app to transfer the emails out via the parallel por=
t.  The 
whole dataflash took several seconds to transfer, but obviously th=
at 
wouldn't be required just for the emails.

I suppose anything is possible.  =
My hunch is that the
mailstation passively receives the data, rather than 
=
fetching it.  I would think, since it is binary data,
that it would be at l=
east base64 or uuencoded.

If by data you mean the TV listin=
gs, or weather, it is
stored right in the app itself, as one big graphic im=
age.

I don't know if they reload the whole 16k page each time
they update =
data, or just the image data (what I named
icon2 in helloapp, maybe not the=
 best name).

XTND, as best I can guess, refers to extensions to the pop

rotocol that allow clipmail commands to work.  I also 
suspect that the "XT=

I think what you are calling demo mi=
ght really be just an 
unlocked unit.  Some mailstations were sold that can=
 use 
any isp, others are locked into using pop.mailstation.com.

One of my=
 mailstations is a demo unit, and it has some 
canned messages in it that c=
annot be erased.  I do not 
think it can be used to get email from a real a=
ccount 
(but I never tried).

It can "get mail" even without plugging it in=
 to a phone 
line, a couple of canned messages are added to the inbox.  
Yo=

really send them.=

that were made are lost, inbox and=

I don't kn=
ow if it is a setting, or different firmware 
that makes these "demo" units=
, but mine most definitly 
says "loading demo data" on the screen when it b=
oots up, 
before the cidco logo appears.  AFAIK, all the mailstations 
have=
 same memory capacity (except 350).

After typing the above, it occurs to m=
e that I can't 
remember if I ever opened up this "demo" unit.  I did 
find=
 *that* one, in a box with several mis-flashed units :-] 

So, I just opene=
d it up, and my first surprise was there 
were no speaker wires holding boa=
rd from coming loose 
from case.  Second was a bit more of a shock, a bunch=
 
of the chips were missing from board!  

The cpu/ram/codeflash/dataflash =
are all there, and same 
capacity as normal units, but none of the modem
ci=
rcuitry is there!!!

So, I guess there is no chance of flashing this one 
i=
nto a normal mailstation.  

The firmware version shown on the settings scr=
een is 
2.53YR, which is the same as the one I had been working 
with.  But=
 in the test mode, it shows it as 
"version 2.53YR Demo", which seems to in=
dicate it is 
special firmware, not just a setting (the missing 
components=
 point that way, too!)

I put a list of the different models that I am awar=
e 
of in groups "database" section.  From what I have 
gathered, any of the=
 various firmware versions can 
be locked or unlocked, where the difference=
 is whether 
you can change the servers or not.  I have noticed 
that some =
firmware versions that include a "R" at 
the end cannot be set to any serve=
r, even with the 
"flash test" method.  All those without the "R" will 
acc=
ept any server after erasing flash.  I checked in 
the code (of either 2.22=
r or 2.53r), and it has 
hardcoded strings that it uses rather than asking =
user 
for pop and smtp entries.

I only dumped a 2.53yr (and I am pretty su=
re I verified 
it against the dump in file area).  I have looked at the 
fi=
rst 4 pages of several firmware versions, after 
flashing sboot into the hi=
gher pages.

I don't intend to *post* any rom images myself, unless 
I get =
permission from Earthlink.  The listing for 
spew.asm was supposed to make =
downloading a rom image 
unnecessary.

> - Do we know what all triggers NMI=
 interrupts?

Both the normal INT, and nonmaskable NMI vector to the 
same =
routine.  Port #03 is polled to find source.  I can 
only speculate on what=
 is activating the interrupts, but 
the ISR has been studied:

if p3.7 call=
er_id_handler
if p3.5 sets bit 0 of #D631 (whatisit???) (related to rtc???)=

if p3.6 Modem handler
if p3.4 increment time16
if p3.3 null
if p3.0 null
i=
f p3.1 KB scan (just 1 row each int), time32, and 10 timers.
if p3.2 null

=
The odd ordering of the port 3 bits reflects the priority
given to each int=
errupt.  Callid is highest priority.

Mailbug can use the=
 mailstations built in reflash.  
That's how we have been installing sboot.=

Mailbug can also write to codeflash w=
ithout using 
the native reflash code, but it needs one of the 
various boo=
t progs (mboot, sboot, or bootapp) to 
load the remote control stuff (mbug)=
.

Mailbug cannot yet write to the dataflash (that 
jogs my memory a bit, t=

was not yet released).

That's pretty odd then, because I de=
finately know mine came from a 
store display, and also has a sticker on it=
 saying "This unit is for 
demo purposes only and will not send/receive ema=
il" towards the top 
left, and a big "NOT FOR RESALE" on the back.  Yet I k=
now it sends 
email and that the modem components are there, because I've u=
sed it 
to receive email in the past.

So I dunno, perhaps this is just an =
unlocked unit as you mentioned, 
just being used as a demo unit.

The one y=
ou have though still sounds perfectly good for using it as a 
development s=
ystem or other useful thing, as long as it can still be 
flashed the same. =
 Even if I ever do get an OS onto my own, I doubt 
I'll even use the modem =
functionality for anything.  I haven't had 
dial-up internet access to mess=
 with for a while now.

Oh hey, I totally missed t=

That one has lots of good tidb=

I wrote my own routines earlier to send out bytes/strings and found 
t=
hat I never needed to set that input/output port for it to work 
correctly.=
  Of course it might have already been set during some MS 
init code, so I'=
ll have to try setting it both ways before I run my 
version of sendbyte, a=
nd see what happens.

It's been a while since I had done any Z80 programming before I got 
into t=
he whole Mailstation thing, so I was referring to the 
documentation on the=
 interrupt modes again earlier, and came to 
realize a trick one could prob=
ably use to hijack it from the MS code 
to your own.  The NMI would still b=
e stuck there, but maybe that 
rarely gets tripped, if ever (depending on w=
hat you're doing?).  Mind 
you, this might be a commonly known trick, I dun=
no, but I thought it 
worth mentioning anyway.

Basically, you put it into =
interrupt mode 2, which is the one where 
you set I to the high address byt=
e of an interrupt table.  When the 
interrupt hits, the external device wri=
tes the low byte (the position 
in the interrupt table) to the processor, a=
nd then it does an 
indirect call to the address stored at that memory loca=
tion.  

Well, I'm fairly sure the MS doesn't have anything that writes thi=
s 
byte back to the processor (hence why it uses interrupt mode 1, which 
c=
alls the fixed address 0x38), meaning some random byte will be there 
on th=
e data bus when the interrupt happens.  But that's the trick: it 
doesn't m=
atter what byte is there.

You can simply use a table of 257 identical byte=
s.  It has to be 257 
bytes instead of 256, since normally, you leave bit 0=
 of the byte fed 
to the processor as 0, so that it'll stay aligned to a ta=
ble of 2-
byte addresses.  Since it may or may not be aligned for us due to=
 a 
random value, we just use one extra byte, in case the random byte the 
=
processor reads happens to be 255.

So, for example, if you set register I =
to C0, and then positioned 
your lookup table from 0xC000 to 0xC100, settin=
g every byte in it to 
like, 40, then when the interrupt hit, it would find=
 the address 
0x4040 no matter where it looked in the table.  Then it would=
 call 
0x4040 for the actual interrupt, which of course is an address insid=
e 
your range of control.

Of course replacing the codeflash is the simples=
t way to do it, but 
this allows you to leave that alone, and still have it=
s functionality 
intact if you need it, but be able to take control of the =
interrupts 
as well if you want.

After finally realizing the simplest of bugs which was keeping my app 
to t=
ransfer code from the pc to mailstation ram from working (didn't 
realize 1=
6-bit dec didn't set the zero flag, doh), I've finally 
gotten to mucking a=
round much more.  Particularly since it doesn't 
require typing in hex code=
 anymore!

But I found something strange.  Basically, with interrupts disab=
led, 
whenever I have the LCD set to accept the current column with the cas=
 
bit in port 2, and then write my column, the lcd goes blank.  When I 
wri=
te to it without cas, it just kind of flickers I think.  But 
commenting ou=
t that simple 'di' instruction makes everything work 
like a charm again.

=
More tinkering seems to reveal that I can still update the screen and 
ever=
ything behind the scenes, then when I reenable interrupts again 
afterwards=
, the screen shows up again properly, with all the data I 
set while it was=
 "off".

Anyone know why the lcd goes away without'em enabled?

Are you using the port 2 shadow var????  And, it just occ=
ured
to me as I typed that, I don't know if we know it's address in
3.03a. =
 Port 2.7 needs to be "1" to keep the LCD on.

While ints=
 are disabled, the mailstation gears pretty much stop 
turning.  After you =
reenable them, it won't be long till ms writes
something to port #02, and i=
t will use the shadow that has 
bit 7 set???  Just a guess.

I don't particulary recall this =
behavior, and I do think I
have had display on while ints were disabled.

I uploaded a rendering of the ms fonts and icons.
http:/=
/tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/files/Mailbug/253yr/

The fonts ar=
e probably mostly the same, if not exactly, for 
all versions????   There's=
 both an eMessage icon, and Mailstation 
icon in this 2.53yr rom.

I also r=
ecently uploaded some assembler code to 
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group=

There is code for the "tribble link" i=
nterface, and another 
file with a bunch of equ's for the ms firmware routi=
nes
that I have been using, and some scrolling text output code, too.

Hey,=
 how did you embed the graphic???  I didn't think we could

I'm not using t=
he shadow bit (which is at 0xDBA5 on 3.03a), but I 
made sure to set all th=
e bits correctly when writing to port 2.  The 
LCD bit is kept on at all ti=
mes.  As I said before, the screen 
doesn't actually go off until I attempt=
 to write the current column 
to the LCD during cas.  Until I do that, the =
LCD is still on, even 
after I setup port 2 and cas, and even with interrup=
ts disabled.  
It's just when writing the column that makes it turn off whe=
n the 
interrupts are disabled.  When I remove only the "di" instruction 
f=
rom my code, it all works just fine again.  This is why it doesn't 
make se=
nse to me.

I thought about trying to use my trick to steal the interrupt r=
outine 
and just immediately ei/reti without handling anything, just to see=
 
if it's something in there causing it.  Maybe I'll also try using the 
sh=
adow bit, just in case.  Anything's worth a shot.

Also, speaking of the LC=
D, it seems the list I had been using of 
Mailstation devices (from I-Appli=
ance) isn't quite accurate.  It says 
device 2 is the right half of the LCD=
, and the left half is device 
4.  It appears to be the opposite, from my e=
xperience.  I also 
checked the disassembled code of the three firmware ver=
sions I know 
of, and it seems to be the same across the board.  Device 2 i=
s the 
left half, updated from the buffer at 0xC010, and device 4 is the 
r=
ight half, updated from 0xCA10.

Ah =
that's a nice list.  It makes me ponder trying to replace the big 
CIDCO lo=
go with one of my own.  Though it seems I don't start up my 
Mailstation no=
rmally enough to see that logo most times.  I almost 
always end up doing a=
 "hard" restart, either by pulling the 
batteries, or jumping to 0x0000.  I=
n the test code I've been working 
with, for example, after it does its mai=
n task, it goes into a loop 
where it just constantly checks for new keyboa=
rd scancodes.  If it 
detects #1 (the Back button), the loop ends, and it j=
umps to 0x0000.  
I'm not really sure yet how to "properly" restart the Mai=
lstation via 
software, to get the logo and all.  I always end up at the sc=
reen 
asking me if I want to erase the flash memory.  I assume during 
shut=
down, the Mailstation is setting some value to designate that it 
was turne=
d off properly via the power button, and when you turn it on 
next, it's ch=
ecking if that was set.

More code to look through is =

Well when I'm typing a message here =
on the Yahoo Groups page, there's 
something along the top just above the "=
To:" field that says "New! 
Compose your message with Rich-Text Editor (Bet=
a)".  I realized I 
couldn't embed images here, so I clicked that.  It take=
s you to a 
different text entry form, with a checkbox at the bottom below =
the 
message body area.  When clicked, it puts your messages into raw html =

mode.  I went in there just long enough to add my img tag.

Welp, I tried using the shadow byte, and crazily enough, it worked 
fine wi=
th interrupts disabled.

The values I was originally writing straight to po=
rt 2 were 0x93 to 
start CAS (turning bit 3 off), then writing my column ad=
dress, 
followed up by writing 0x9B to port 2 to toggle CAS back.

Assuming=
 this is still all accurate:
7-lcd_on, 6-callid_data, 5-not_modem_power, 4-=
yougotmail_LED, 3-
LCD_cas, 2-callid_data_rdy, 1-keyrow_9, 0-keyrow_8

The =
0x93 I wrote is 10010011.  lcd_on is obviously enabled.  I was 
also turnin=
g on the LED to know when I got to this point.  Bits 0 and 
1 are high beca=
use that's where the interrupt routine keeps them, and 
only pulls them low=
 when reading from that row of the keyboard 
matrix.  0x9B is 10011011, wit=
h the only difference being the CAS bit.


Oh ho!  I just found something! =
 Instead of the values I had been 
writing, I decided to write 0xF7 (111101=
11) to start CAS, wrote my 
address, then wrote 0xFF (11111111).  It worked=
 fine!  I then traced 
it down to exactly which bit needed to be on:  bit 5=
.  If bit 5 is 
not on when you write your column address during cas, the L=
CD goes 
off.  Why do you suppose that is??

Since I sometimes don't know for sure if a particular parameter can 
be use=
d with a certain Z80 instruction, I just try it anyway, and 
then see if it=
 compiles.  If I get an error, I just check the 
datasheet, and then learn =
from my mistake.  Well it seems that 
there's a little bug in AS80 which ca=
uses a minor issue if you try a 
particular invalid command.

Basically, if=
 you try to use "add hl, ix", you end up with "add ix, 
ix".  Same is true =
for "add hl, iy", getting "add iy, iy".  I 
couldn't figure out what was wr=
ong with some of my code, and testing 
it in a Z80 simulator revealed what =
was going on.  I manually checked 
the opcode bytes too to make sure the si=
mulator might not be screwy, 
but sure enough, AS80 was generating improper=
 instructions in those 
two cases.

Now of course, you can't actually add i=
x to hl, as the datasheet 
would indicate, so my code was in error.  But it=
 obviously should 
have errored out instead of continuing on, and using a d=
ifferent 
instruction even.  

I tried this both in versions 1.11 (found he=
re in the Files section), 
and 1.41 (the newest on his site), same thing.  =
So I contacted the 
author about it, and he said he'd fix it.  But I figure=
d I'd point it 
out for anyone else here using that one, in case they might=
 make the 
same mistake I did.


Speaking of bugs, I also found that v1.41 =
is now giving me errors 
when including a file of "db" strings (for the fon=
t I'm including 
with the code), yet if I assemble the same code with v1.11=
, it works 
fine.  So I dunno what's going on there.

Why not check for a "back key" event, and handle it, to=

If jp #0000 gives that menu even with batteries in, t=
hen you
probably do need to set a state var, and it is prob that first
var =
that is saved in the routine called "Init" on your disassembly.
I'd tell yo=
u the location, but it might be different on your 3.03a.

Try setting that =
var to #5A before reboot.  The "moreinit"
routine checks for that value, an=
d sets a different "app mode"
depending if that var was #5A.  I don't know =
what the difference
is, though.  Maybe it is whether or not you get that me=
nu (seems
like a good guess).

If that doesn't work, I just don't know what=
 else is involved.

When I run code from mailbug, I end with a ret.  If all=
 goes
well, mbug gets control again, and I can issue more commands.
Otherwi=
se, I hit the reset button (I leave a jeweler's screwdriver
sticking out of=
 the reset hole, 'coz I need to hit it often!)

I rarely have batteries ins=
talled, and I thought that was why
I was seeing that message all the time.
=

Another thought I just had was that the mailstation does not boot
up from =
scratch when you turn it on with power button.  That's
because it doesn't r=
eally shut off when you push power button.
It just goes to sleep.  So, when=
 you push button to "turn it on"
you are really just waking it up.  Maybe i=
t always asks that 
question when it boots up from #0000?

Maybe there is a bus conflict if the modem is on when you are

I pretty much have tried to=
 avoid depending on all Mailstation 
functions as much as possible, particu=
larly its whole message loop 
system.  The only thing I'm currently dependi=
ng on with code I'm 
working on is getkeycodefrombuffer, until I write a ro=
utine to handle 
scanning the keyboard matrix myself.  Seems easy enough, I=
 just 
haven't gotten around to it, from trying to deal with text output 
f=
irst.

I've gotten routines in place for a decent text-mode interface, with=
 
a 640-byte buffer to hold 40x16 characters.  I can either write to 
the m=
emory buffer and then run a routine to update it all at once, or 
I can upd=
ate it one character at a time (which also writes to the 
buffer, but is be=
tter for printing strings instead of updating the 
whole display).  It also=
 tracks the cursor x/y position to know where 
to put the next character.

=
I just need a routine to map scancodes to keys, track whether shift/
caps l=
ock is on, etc, and I'll have my own basic i/o routines to work 
with.

Act=
ually I just remembered, I just recently started using a second 
Mailstatio=
n function:  powerdownmode.  I tried emulating what it's 
doing, but someti=
mes the thing just resets instead of fully staying 
off.  Haven't figured t=
hat out yet.  It certainly appears like bit 1 
of port 28 seems to play an =
important part in shutting down, though.  
But now, Back resets me to #0000=
, while the power button turns it 
off.  Pushing any other button prints it=
s scan code (and status of up/
down/shift/capslock below), and prints the a=
scii representation of 
the scancode on the screen (and incrementing the cu=
rsor position 
along the way).  This will be neater when it's actually disp=
laying 
the corresponding letter to the key I'm pressing!

As mentioned bef=
ore I think, I was trying to stray from using 
Mailstation code when possib=
le so that I never have to rely on any of 
it in the event that I replace i=
t.  Relying on Mailstation code also 
means relying on where it locates thi=
ngs in ram, and trying to avoid 
writing over any of it.

Yeah this was something I found out when reading over that =

disassembled/commented page 0.  I can't try it until I find out the

v3.03a location though, as you mentioned.  But if I'm possibly

I saw that button when I was messing with it the othe=

I've used the same set of batteries in it since I first started=
 
mucking around, and I only once saw a low battery warning at startup, 
an=
d that was when I forgot and left it running for a few minutes in 
an app I=
 was testing (since no auto-shutoff).  It's surprisingly good 
on batteries=
, especially considering it never truly goes off.  I

This also means the ram retains its contents, which could =

method of code storage.  A ram drive, of sorts.  Would let you=
 avoid 
writing to the flash unless necessary.

Yeah!  
=

I was trying to imagine just how this kind of mistake could 
happen.  I me=
an, does as80 actually have "add hl,ix" in a table
of opcodes???  I'll bet =
it doesn't.

All of the ix & iy instructions use same opcode as the
corespo=
nding hl instruction, except there is an extra byte
in front that tells cpu=
 to use ix or iy instead of hl.

So, probably when as80 sees an ix anywhere=
 in an instruction,
it emits the ix prefix byte, and then converts the ix t=
o hl,
and assembles it as an hl instruction.  But it needs to check
if ix i=
s allowed in that position first!!!

A "DD" in front means use ix instead o=
f hl, and "FD" means
use iy.  I don't think there are any valid instruction=
s with
both hl and ix, or hl and iy, and I guess that also means you 
can't=
 have both ix and iy either.  And not all insts that can
use hl can substit=
ute ix (or iy).  

"ex de,hl" is valid, but "ex de,ix" is not.  AS80 does
c=
atch that!  So much for my earlier theory...

That's great!  And it's good to know it is still being maintaine=
d.

I remember finding a bug in a 6805 assembler that I downloaded
directly=
 from Motorola.  I was finding lots of "lost clusters"
on my hard drive, bu=
t I had no idea why.  Windows would crash
for some totally unrelated reason=
, and when it rebooted and
checked the disk, it told me it was finding lost=
 clusters.
Most of the time, it was not the program that crashed that
had l=
ost them, or even any program that I used that day.

Of course, windows wou=
ld crash quite often, and not find any
lost clusters.

After many frustrati=
ng weeks, a pattern emerged: I had used
the motorola assembler recently.  I=
 tested theory by using
chkdsk before and after, and sure enough, EVERY TIM=
E I ran
it, I had lost clusters.

Oh wow!  I found a bug in Motorola's asse=
mbler!!!  I
called them up (this was a long time ago) and told the
"tech su=
pport" guy.  Turns out they knew about it already.
Turns out they knew abou=
t it for quite a while.  Like 3 or 
4 years.  Turns out, they even had docu=
mented it, deep down 
in a part of the doc that most people would never nee=
d to read.

I guess I'll just have to imagine how good it felt to hear 
bac=
k that he was gonna fix your bug.  :-)

(Oh yeah, right around that time Ph=
ilips had a design contest 
where you could get their software and chip pro=
grammer for like
$30 bucks.  I haven't used any Motorola parts since.  Are
=
they even in business anymore?)

What kind of error?  Does it work if=
 you paste the file in,
rather than include it?  Or, is it a difference in =
handling
of the "db" itself?

Clearly you've never used a Forth assembler :-)

I=
 can only assume that they wrote the assembler in assembly as well, 
becaus=

higher level=
 language, as far as I can tell.

Sounds like that was back in the pre-Win2=
K days though, when Windows 
would actually let you destroy and mess up thi=
ngs without stopping 
you.  These days most everything's all sandboxed (in =
the case of old 
DOS apps), or usually only accessable via the Windows API.=
  But 
luckily people sometimes come up with ways to still interface with 
=
hardware, such as the DLLs to write to I/O ports, letting me talk 
directly=
 to the parallel port and such.

There's still a charm about being able to =
still have that level of 
hardware control, though, which is why I still ke=
ep Win98, as well as 
Linux, on my laptop (and XP for when I actually want =
to use Windows 
productively).  I was working on some raw floppy drive cont=
roller 
routines in assembly once and was using Win98 to test'em, especiall=
y 
since it also let you drop straight into DOS mode.  Though this was 
als=
o about the time I realized that using floppy drives in projects 
was a cra=
zy idea, when compact fash and SD were much easier to deal 
with.  And CF i=
s basically 8-bit IDE even, so interfacing a full hard 
drive would still b=
e easier than a floppy.

Yeah there's a level of disappointment to think that you've=
 
discovered something only to find out that it was found long before.  
Bu=
t in that case, it's even more disappointing to think the company 
would si=
t on it that long without bothering to fix it.  Especially 
when you pretty=

Surprisingly so, after what you said.

It pretty much tells me "Redefi=
nition of label" for every label 
following the included file.  It didn't u=
sed to do this though; it 
wasn't till my main file got bigger that it comp=
lained.  It also 
looks kind of odd, writing over some of the output text w=
hen it puts 
out these errors.  Like how it'll say stuff like "Reading line=
 500" 
and whatnot, you know.  It starts spitting the error text out on top=
 
of it, instead of under it like a legit error.

I tried what you mentione=
d though, and strangely enough, it compiled 
just fine when the data was ad=
ded into the main file.  I didn't 
really have enough info to go on to repo=
rt this one to the fellow, 
but I think this might be enough to help him tr=
ack it down to the 
'include' option somehow.  I'll let him know the sympto=
ms.  I'm sure 
he'll feel overjoyed to be hearing from me yet again.  ;)

In Forth you just execute word after word. Either it's a number and it
goes on the stack, or it's a subroutine and it runs, consuming values
from the stack, possibly putting some back on.

So a Forth assembler typically has constants that represent the
operands. These end up as values on the stack.

SO

H   L   MOV,

MOV, pops the values pushed by H and L constants, Or's them together
with its base opcode, and appends the resulting instruction byte to
the dictionary.

Try some random combination of operands that it doesn't expect, and
hilarity ensues. It will put something in the dictionary, probably not
the instruction you expect though...

That's sounds pretty cool.  :-)

I have wondered myself if the lcd buff=
er provids any real benefit,
or if it was just there to let the progrmmers =
defer thinking about 
how to get image on the screen (possibly defer to ano=
ther team?).  
I don't see any particular timing issue.

For that matter, t=
he ms code doesn't even copy directly from 
the font data to lcd buffer.  E=
ach character is copied to a 
"char buffer", and then copied to the lcd buf=
fer.  Seems like 
it would be much more efficient to just copy from font di=
rectly 
to lcd, and skip both buffers!

If you look at the code for=
 "powerdownmode", it is bit 0 
that shuts it off.  Oh wow!  I was just look=
ing at the 
disassembly.  I thought you were saying "powerdown" which 
is a=
t 1AC0 in 2.53yr.

"powerdownmode" is just a wrapper that sets bootstate to=
 5A, 
and then calls "powerdown"!!!  I didn't even remember that 
was there=
, but I must have seen it, 'coz I named it!  There 
is just too much to rem=
ember about this thing.  :-)

And, unlike "powerdown" , which might float a=
round in 
different versions, "powerdownmode" has one of those handles 
in =
that real long jump table. 

So, I bet you can call powerdownmode at #0A6B =
in all versions.  
I seem to recall that jumptable is at same address in th=
e 
versions I looked at.

But what I started to say was, if you look at the=
 code for 
"powerdown" @1AC0 in the 2.53 disassembly, you'll see that 
it i=
s toggling P28.0

P28.0 is connected to the power control flip-flop (74c74 =
chip)
via a 600 ohm resistor.  I don't completely understand circuit, 
ther=
e are several caps and resistors, and 2 stages of D type
flip-flop, but the=
 gist of it seems to be that a pulse on 
P28.0 sets the flip-flop to the "p=
oweroff" state, after a 
short delay.  I think the delay is there to give c=
pu time to 
execute up to the "halt" inst before removing power from the 
c=
odeflash chip.  (I'm talking about RC time-constant delay 
of pulse, NOT th=
e delay loop in the code.  That delay loop 
is just timing the pusle width.=
)  I don't know if the cpu 
loses power here or not.

I made a mistake when=
 I identified callid dataclock as 
P28.2, it is really P28.1.  The  "xor 02=
" instruction 
is flipping bit 1, but my brain seems to have trouble 
grasp=
ing that, and wants to call it bit 2.  That led to 
all the P28 bits being =
jogged over 1 bit.  I changed the 
datasheet in groups file section, eventu=

I was just now looking to see where "powerdownmode" is 
called.  It is =
from keyscan, which I guess makes some 
sense, if you think of powerbutton =
as a special "key".  
I'm not really sure offhand what happens at poweron, =

though.  Does it continue from the "halt", or start 
over at #0000?  I nee=
d to look at databook, and it's 
not handy right now.

How much ram do you =
need?  The lcd buffer is 5k, and you 
reduced yours to 640 bytes, so you go=
t 4.4k right there.  
The modem buffer is where I have been sticking the mb=
ug 
code.  That should be safe, as long as modem is not used.

Did you see =
the RAM "disassembly"?  It's not really  
disassembly, but I put some notes=
 in the comment file 
for rampage #00.  (ms always has rampage #00 mapped 
=
into slotC000.)   

I also tagged the data types by hand for the vars that =

are known. 
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/files/Mailbug/2=
53yr/ms253yr_80.html


Then there is the stack.  You can allocate space for=
 
*any* routine that needs local vars, by just calling 
the same routine th=
at the compiled c code uses.  I 
named it "localize" in the disassembly, be=
cause it 
was creating a local context for each function.
In addition to al=
locating stack for local vars, 
it also saves all the regs for you.  

You =
just load DE with number of bytes you need for 
locals, and call localize. =
 Then you can access your 
locals relative to the stack pointer.  

The fir=
st local byte is at sp+8.  Any params are at 
sp+8+n+4  (iow, last local ad=
dr + 5).

The cleanup is automatic, your code just needs to "return".

It just asserts the CPU's reset pin, so p=

I uploaded a bunch of stuff: mailbug 0.0.4, bootapp, new version
of helloap=
p, and some comment files for mailbugs disassembler.
Also a file called cru=
nch.dat, which has tags for data and code.
(Comments and crunch.dat are for=
 2.53yr.)

New in 0.0.4 is mainly ability to load splash screen in stock
ma=
ilstation, and ability to embed bootapp.rom file in
the splash screen.  It =
has to be named bootapp.rom, and it
needs to be in mbug subdir.

Splash scr=
een files need to be in monochrome .bpm format.
Max size is 320x128.  I see=
m to remember having trouble
with smaller images, but that might be fixed n=
ow???
Filenames need to be "splashX.bmp", where X is a number.
You need a f=
ile named "splash6.bmp" if you want to load
bootapp, 'coz I hardcoded it to=
 embed bootapp.rom in
that image file.  Splash image files go in subdir "mi=
sc".

0.0.4 also has the "inhale" function, but it is not in menu.
Command =
is "<", and I don't remember exactly how you get it
to sync with "spew", yo=
u might need to run both at almost
exact same time to avoid timeouts.  boot=
app makes this
obsolete, though.  You can just "save" rom image after 
load=
ing bootapp.

One other notable new feature of 0.0.4 is a symbol table.
The=
 symbol data is stored as a comment with a special tag
that tells disassemb=
ler it is a symbol, and value is simply
the address where that comment is f=
ound.  Disassembler
will plug symbol in whenever it sees that address.

Unf=
ortunately, it plugs symbol in whenever a constant
has that value, too, eve=
n if it is just coincidence.  
Makes for some odd looking disassembled code=
 in places!

There are some new commands relating to symbols, I don't 
thin=
k they are documented anywhere yet (but I need to 
hit the sack now).

T=

I guess it's not a good idea to pass a pointer to a page that =
might 
not stay put!!!  :-)  :-)  :-)

It seemed innocent enough to pass a =
pointer to a constant string
defined within the app.  But the app runs from=
 slot4000, and the 
call to "draw_app_foldertab" uses slot4000, too.  By th=
e time
the string is actually used, several other pages have been slapped
i=
nto slot4000, too.  

So, I declared a local var on the stack, and copied i=
t there.
(The stack is in slotC000, which never changes.)

It works now!!!

Thanks!!!

Well from my experience, it would p=
robably be slower to write 
directly to the lcd all the time, because of th=
e math involved to 
translate pixel coordinates.  You have to figure out wh=
ich lcd device 
to swap into the slot, which column you need to activate, t=
hen which 
row inside of there to write the bit to, and then which bit insi=
de 
the byte is the particular pixel you're wanting to change.  You then 
h=
ave to pretty much do these calculations for all the pixels you're 
writing=
, because you don't know when one will cross into another 
column, or even =
into the other lcd device.

The math to just draw this stuff on a buffer wi=
th standard x/y 
coordinates would be simpler, and then doing one big incre=
mental pass 
across the lcd columns/devices after you've drawn all you need=
 to the 
buffer would likely take less time in the long run.

This is parti=
ally why I chose an 8x8 font size to work with in what 
I've been messing w=
ith, because it's always aligned to a particular 
lcd column.  I just have =
figure out which column the character needs 
to be written to, and then the=
 starting row inside of there, and dump 
8 bytes of font data in.

I didn't qu=
ite get this at first either, but then I realized that it 
probably makes s=
ense for when they're wanting to modify the text in 
some way.  Particularl=
y to invert the color.  You wouldn't really 
want to try and invert the fon=
t once it hit the actual lcd buffer, 
cause you might invert bits to other =
graphical data around/underneath 
the character you just wrote.

Well, I did finish my routines to scan the matrix, det=
ect changes, 
and put the scancodes of those changes into a buffer.  But th=
en I 
found that certain letters on my keyboard are twitchy and sometimes 
=
trigger too many presses/depresses.  I then realized that all the 
extra st=
uff the MS code was doing was likely debouncing the keys.  
Since I'm almos=
t tired of just writing keyboard routines for now (and 
have gotten distrac=
ted away from it lately as well), I'm thinking I 
might just pull all their=
 routines I need out for now and put them in 
my own code to possibly be re=
written later, so that I can move onto 
more interesting stuff.

The proble=
m with just leaving them in the Mailstation code is the 
page swapping requ=
ired to get to them.  One of those "wormhole" 
functions in page 0 might he=
lp keep it from being a problem in some 
respects, but if I ever tried to h=
ijack the interrupt for example, it 
could be a problem yet again.  So I'd =
prefer to just keep my own 
pages activated when possible, by just copying =
out their code.

Back in =
my DOS days I seem to remember that pressing any of those

Well my intention was to preferably have the entire up=
per 32K as ram 
for my own use (OS, running applications, etc).  That'd bas=
ically 
make a 32k machine, while using slot4000 for paging the lcd/datafla=

ram (for a ramdrive perhaps) for I/O.  It also works out well to 
start=
 the OS code at the 32k point, because then if I ever tried to 
convert any=
 CP/M apps, for example, I'd mostly only need to toggle 
the upper address =
bit in any spots where they accessed memory.

I only wish I knew more about=
 when an NMI interrupt hit, because if 
it rarely or never happens aside fr=
om like modem use (which I'll 
never use), then I could use all the page 0 =
ram without worry, by 
just turning off maskable interrupts, or hijacking t=
he routine.

Yeah, I realized that about half a seco=

I just meant I don't think there is any need to sync=

writes with any video-like timing (retrace), or any wait states
gen=

When painting whole screen, it can be faster to use buffer,

But if you are d=
isplaying text, I don't think the overhead of 
accessing the LCD directly i=
s that big a deal, compared to
copying the whole screen, particularly if yo=
u are just updating 
a small area, such as a "writeln".  You would just hav=
e the 
X coord overhead once per char, (with your 8x8 font).

If you were u=
sing proportional font, you could buffer two 8x8 
or 8x11 pixel areas, and =
copy each to LCD after curor moves past. 
That would save the 5KB used for =
current LCD buffer.  

Also, scrolling the LCD would be faster directly on =
LCD.  And 
clearing screen, too.  (But the question may be moot, see below.=
)

I think I figured out an even better reason for what a=

seemed like a lot of needless copying, not only in LCD routines, bu=
t
a lot of other places:  The bank switching!!!

Since they chose a banking=
 scheme where the codeflash, dataflash,

ot4000, you can't copy
directly between two of them!  Same problem as my or=

I'd have to check to be sure, but I think the keyboard code mi=

all be in page 00?

And, even if you do want to use a function from one=
 of the higher 
pages, you don't need to do the bankswitching, you just cal=

through the handles in page 00, and the bankswitching is done for
yo=
u, including puting your page back before they return.

But, as we have see=

I think pascal (well, turbo=

I didn't even know the right name.  I have been away fr=

I see.  You are go=

around the ram that existing=
 isr uses).

My hunch i=
s there is no NMI, but I could be wrong.  

I had thought about reflashing =
page 00 to put a hook into isr so I 
could borrow it.  Find a free RAM loca=
tion (maybe move stack down
4 or 8 bytes) and init it to "jp oldisr" (with =
a patch to init in 
page 00).  Then patch the existing jp oldisr in page 00=
 to jump to 
that new jp in ram.

But what I really need more than the ISR =
is to borrow one of the 
"restarts", for the breakpoint mechanism.  Not exa=
ctly rocket science.
just haven't got "a round tuit".  

Probably 'coz I sp=

Yeah t=
he keyboard stuff is in page 0, but the problem is that it 
still uses piec=
es of ram way up in the C000-FFFF range.  So I pulled 
all the keyboard rou=
tines out of the disassembled listing, fixed them 
up and re-labeled them s=
o that they'd assemble again, and created the 
variables in memory where I =
wanted.  But I'm having problems with 
it.  

The topmost function the inte=
rrupt calls seems to be the one at 
0x2FE3 (keyscan).  So I'm calling that,=
 then calling my pulled 
version of getkeycodefrombuffer, and looping these=
 if it doesn't find 
a key (which is how I did it with the built-in routine=
s before, just 
minus the call to the 0x2FE3 one, since that's done in inte=
rrupt).  I 
can get the power and back buttons, since it handles them separ=
ately, 
but it either doesn't read anything else, or reads a bunch of 
gibb=
erish for a moment and then stops reading anything (aside from 
back and po=
wer).

I'm calling my pulled init_keyboard and clearing a couple of the 
va=
riables the functions use before I get there, but I dunno, maybe 
I'm missi=
ng something.  There might be some initialization called at 
startup in pag=
e 6 of codeflash that I don't know about.  I don't have 
any commented vers=
ions of that page, so it's tough to go through.  
I'm almost tempted to jus=
t forget it and write my own debouncing code 
for what I already have.  See=
ms like it might be easier at this point 
than trying to debug that entire =
mess, unless you have any ideas.

I use Perl a lot myself since it=
's so easy to use, and generally 
works fine cross-platform for testing and=
 debugging and such 
(depending on the modules).  For C, I got that Dev-C++=
 thing before 
for Windows, but ended up not really caring for the GUI, so =
I just 
setup the environment variables to it so that it's pretty much just=
 
back to basic gcc/g++ and 'make' from the command line.  I keep it 
all i=
nstalled since it has a package system in the GUI that lets me 
update it a=
nd other libraries fairly easily.


>

The keyboard routines seem to get called from an NMI (s=
ince NMI and 
maskable interrupts apparently go to the same place), but I f=
ound 
that I never get keyboard input (using the mailstation's built-in 
fu=
nctions) with interrupts disabled.  So you could be right, there 
may just =
never be one, or never one unless using the modem or some 
such thing that =
I'll never do.

I'm kind of afraid of trying anything like that, but=
 it seems like 
the best way to deal with doing anything with the thing in =
the long 
run.  I fear that I'll write code, but not take into account some=
 
sort of initialization aspect that the MS does, and then when my code 
go=
es on there, it'll just be a brick.

I'm also not exactly sure what process=
 I'd go about using to flash 
any of it.

That looks like right=
 address in 2.53yr.  I was wondering if 
calling in a loop might not give e=
nough settling time for row
select?  I can't look at it right now (won't be=
 home till tues),
but does ms scan whole matrix each time 2fe3 is called? 
=
Or just one row???  I seem to remember wondering why 
row address was set w=
hen it was, and extra settling time 
was my only guess as to why.  If that =
is prob, maybe doing
a 1ms delay in your loop would help.

As far as I could see (I looked at keyboard =
code last night,
before I left) the keyscan vars are not init to anything b=
eyond
the zeroing of ram in init.  The page 6 init relating to keyboard
is =
mostly for the reading of buffer, andconverting to key events.
They also en=
able keyboard int, which you wouldn't need, and
make a call to keyboard ini=
t, which you probably do need.  I
am not sure what param is for, but they p=
ush #0000 on stack
before calling keyboard init.  I think keyboard init is =
neccesary 
for initing keybuffer.

> I don't have 
> any commented versions=
 of that page, so it's tough to go through.  

That is next one I will post=
.  There are some mistakes I was correcting,
and alway seems there is new d=
etails to add.  The most interesting
stuff in page 6 is the event loop, and=
 related queue, and event
generating.

Also, the app table is init there, a=
long with the widget stuff.

I did some experiments the other night, settin=
g bootstate =3D 5a
before jp 0, and it worked (didn't get the "memory testi=
ng", or
"reset system data" menu.  AFAICT, the ram gets completely
zeroed e=
ither way, only difference is what app/screen you get to
on bootup (splash,=
 or mem test).  Seems the "ram valid" is

But think of the rush you get when it works!!! :-)

A =
bricked mailstation is a pretty low price to pay, and you might
get it righ=
t the first try.  If only *all* the mistakes we make
could be limited to th=
e cost of a new mailstation!!!

I started writing patch, but did n=
ot finish yet.  Basic approach
would be:

1) create patch.  
1.5) save rom =
image to file, if you don't already have one.
2) load rom image into RAM ta=
rget of mailbug.  
3) apply the patch.  
4) save image to file (you need pa=
ges 0, 1, 2, & 3, 'coz you have to
erase that much).
5) using MBUG target, =
erase pgs 0, 1, 2, 3.
5.5) don't reboot mailstation!!!!!!
6) still using mb=
ug target, write patched image to codeflash.
7) successfully reboot your pa=
tched mailstation.
8) stand up, raise two fists in air, and sing chourus of=
 "I've Got the
Power".
9) remember to *not* spike your mailstation in endzo=
ne!

(OK, I usually do step 8 while still seated.)

So I finally did exactly what I mentioned here, to try making my own 
entir=
e interrupt, and came across a few little gotchas that I thought 
was worth=
 sharing.

Oh yeah, first of all, I apparently didn't come up with the 257 =

identical byte table for interrupt mode 2, after seeing some other 
write-=
ups on z80 interrupts on the web.  I kinda had a feeling that I 
surely did=
n't invent something for such an old processor, considering 
there are coun=
tless smarter people in the electronics/programming 
fields than me.  Not t=
he first time I've "invented" something 
somebody else already did.  But it=
 made me feel smart for a little 
while, at least!

Anyhoo, since I'm not u=
sing the normal video memory buffer, I 
somewhat randomly decided to use #c=
1c1 for my interrupt location 
(putting #c1 in my 257 byte interrupt table =
of course).  Though I'm 
actually just putting a jump here to code in my ma=
in chunk.  This 
actually led to some problems for me, because AS80 was "op=
timizing" 
my code, converting the JP to a JR, and it took me forever to re=
alize 
it.  So I finally bit the bullet and disabled optimizations.  Prolly=
 
shoulda done it from the get go.

Once I got that out of the way, I found=
 out something else strange.  
If I re-enabled interrupts before my RETI, i=
t would freeze up.  For a 
while I was just re-enabling them in part of my =
keyboard loop 
(outside the interrupt), but I knew something had to be wron=
g, since 
the MS interrupt ends with an EI and works fine.  I actually even=
 did 
a jump to #0038 at the end of my own interrupt (effectively making it=
 
a hook), and it worked fine.  

So it wasn't until looking over the MS co=
de that I realized that it 
was toggling the bit of the current interrupt o=
n port #03.  It seemed 
to be the only thing it COULD have been.  And sure =
enough, toggling 
that bit makes my interrupt work fine, letting me end it =
with the 
standard EI/RETI like I wanted.  So that's important to know.  I'=
m 
just curious what exactly toggling the bits does in the hardware, as 
to=
 what would cause it to freeze up like it was doing (unless I re-
enabled i=
nterrupts outside the interrupt routine).

After I added my toggling, I rea=
lized that the time16 interrupt was 
much slower than I had previously expe=
rienced.  With toggling, time16 
occurred every 1 second.  Before I figured=
 that out, the interrupt 
was happening pretty rapidly (perhaps not togglin=
g the bit was making 
the interrupt happen repeatedly?).  My bare interrupt=
 routine is 
actually just incrementing a 16-bit value, which I then displa=
y the 
content of in my main program code loop, which is how I was able to =

see how fast the interrupt was occuring.  Turning the keyboard 
interrupt =
on makes it count really fast again, but I'm not sure of 
the time interval=
 there.

I then put my own version of my keyboard routine in the interrupt,=
 
and found it was freezing if I call it after toggling that bit.  
Doing i=
t beforehand fixed that, as did calling it after setting the 
bit to zero, =
but before setting the bit back on again.  This seems to 
be the method use=
d by the MS routine anyway, so I figure I should 
handle it like that from =
now on.

I ended up disassembling it a second time=
 since I thought I might 
have messed up during my labeling process, but it=
 turned out to just 
be some minor issues elsewhere.  I was declaring my 'k=
eybuffer' 
variable as just 32 bytes instead of 64, and had to set 'keycols=
tate' 
and 'keycolstate2' to #FF during init.  

So basically my entire key=
board initialization is:
- Activate all keyboard rows (MS appears to do it)=

- Set 'flagz', 'keyscanstate', and 'anotherkeyvar' to 0 (I don't see 
MS d=
oing this, but I figure it's best to do it)
- Set 'keycolstate' and 'keycol=
state2' to #FF (if set to 0, they 
trigger a power button press)
- call ini=
t_keyboard

This lets all of the keyboard routines I pulled out of the firm=
ware 
work properly, using my own variables as well, so that none of the 
a=
ctual firmware code or variables are needed anymore.

For anyone that might=
 be interested, here's some variable locations 
in the v3.03a firmware that=
 I jotted down along the way:

flagz			equ	#D631
kbd_last_up_keycode	equ	#D=
A46
keybuffer		equ	#E5AF
keybuffin		equ	#E5EF
keybuffout		equ	#E5F0
keycols=

keyscansta=

keytable1		equ	#E60=

I have to admit that I haven't used mailbug yet s=
ince it apparently 
needs DOS.  But I can pull my laptop out and try it on =
there if I 
decide to patch, since it boots to a few different OS's.  

Out=
 of curiosity, what process are you using to initiate a code 
flash?  Is it=
 like a trigger over the parallel port, or are you 
loading some software o=
nto the MS and doing it with internal 
functions?

I noticed my MS did some=
thing weird the other day when the power was 
fluctuating some during a cod=
e transfer (my power jack and AC adapter 
are a bit wiggly).  It prompted m=
e to do a firmware update, but then 
failed almost immediately.  I'm fairly=
 sure there's no way I could 
accidently screw it up in such a manner thoug=
h, since it does I CRC 
check and stuff I think from what I've seen in the =
code.  

And yes, alas, I finally went to an AC adapter.  Those batteries I=
 
had been using finally spewed their last scancode to the screen, 
until i=
t started to gripe at me nonstop about them being low and 
force itself off=
 again when I'd try to start it up.

So since I can hook/replace the interrupt fairly easily via 
software, 
I t=
hought it might be worth trying to hook the startup procedure 
too.  This w=
ay one could test code that they might one day decide to 
flash onto codefl=
ash page 0, without so much of the risk to bricking 
the thing by a silly m=
istake.  Only problem is that this of course 
means flashing it to some deg=
ree in order to place the hook.

There appears to be 33 empty bytes at the =
start of page 0.   Now I 
know that these are probably left that way in cas=
e a RST command is 
sent.  But are these ever even used by the MS?  That se=
ems to be the 
real kicker here.  If at any point they do get executed, I'd=
 be in 
trouble.  We know it sets interrupt mode 1 at startup, so at least =

they'd never get triggered in that manner.

But, assuming they're never us=
ed, it should be easy to make a 
signature test on a section in ram, and if=
 it verifies, then you 
jump 
to your code in ram.  If the bytes didn't ver=
ify, then normal 
Mailstation startup would carry on instead.  This means y=
ou could 
use 
a normal Mailstation Yahoo-style app to load your code, then=
 as long 
as the power was never removed, your code should remain intact un=
til 
overwritten or power is lost.  So you'd be able to reboot the MS and 
=
test your startup code, and if for whatever reason it had a problem, 
you'd=
 just have to pull the power to kill the ram contents.

33 bytes isn't a lo=
t to work in, but it seems to be enough with a 
couple to spare for doing a=
 three byte signature.  The MS only does 
two bytes for checking its own da=
ta at startup, but since this is 
code, I figure three might be better.  Wh=
o knows!  I mostly just 
decided on three to use my initials.  ;)  I figure=
 this should do 
the 
trick:

	org #0000
	 
	di				; disable interrupts, in=
 
case 
we jump here
	
	ld	a, 1			; set ram page 1 into 
slot8000
	out	(#08=
), a
	out	(#07), a	
	
	ld	hl, #8003		; Test first byte
	ld	a, SIGBYTE1
	cp	=
(hl)
	jr	nz, code_end
	
	inc	hl			; Test second byte
	ld	a, SIGBYTE2
	cp	(h=
l)
	jr	nz, code_end
	
	inc	hl			; Test third byte
	ld	a, SIGBYTE3
	cp	(hl)
=
	jr	nz, code_end
	
	jp	#8000			; Code seems good, jump to 
it	
	
code_end:	=
			; Code not valid, normal boot


This fits into 30 bytes. It assumes you =
load your code at #8000 on 
ram 
page 1 on slot8000, with a JP taking the f=
irst three bytes, and then 
the next three being your signature.  But that =
can be changed around 
to suit one's needs of course.

But again, the worry=
 is the RST bytes.  If I fill them up, and then 
it executes one at some im=
portant point, I might possibly have 
bricked it.  So I'm mostly wondering =
if it was ever confirmed as to 
their usage.  It just seems like there'd re=
ally be no reason for them 
to ever do so, considering they can jump to #00=
00 for the same 
effect.

 Hopefully the message still makes sense.

Not quite wysiwyg, huh???  :-)

=
On the group web site there is (now) an option to view 
messages with a fix=
ed-width font, which puts the 
message inside <pre> </pre> tags.

That will=
 make columns line up again.

To bad you can't just select that when you po=

But if you use the rich text option to compose a
message, I think you c=
an force message to keep
cols lined up.

It used to be you had to hit reply=
 button, and
quoted msg would have the cols lined up in the 
reply box.  So=
 Yahoo has always been keeping
the original (correctly formatted) text.  It=
's
just that they assume formatting does not matter,
a bad assumption, part=
icularly on a programming

It sounds like clearing the p3.x output port bit m=
ay be clearing the
coresponding p3.x input port bit.  

The in & out bits a=
re not the same, the existence of the shadow
indicates you can't read back =
what you last wrote.  It seems like
the output bits serve to enable the res=
pective interrupt, and now
you have found evidence that setting the enable =
bit low also clears
the request bit.  Good work!!!  Maybe you would even sa=
y it serves as
an "acknowledge" to the interrupting hardware?

The slower one is probably correct.  I =
don't know if time16 is even 
used anywhere, the only reference I found to =
it was the increment
in the ISR.  It is possible it was used by one of the =
functions
that got scraped out by version 2.53yr (caller id????).

Did your=
 keyscan work when time16 was flying?  Oh wait, I bet it
did, since it's no=
t int based, right???

).  

I'll venture a hypothesis:  Without the toggle of out-P3.4, the in-bi=
t
was not cleared.  Since time16 int has a higher priority than 
keyboard i=
nt, time16 handler was catching keyboard ints.  When you 
added the  toggle=
 of out-P3.4 the keyboard ints were now handled by 
the keyboard int handle=
r.  

And by toggle, I really mean setting low.  You need to set high again=
 
to re-enable the int.

Cool!!!

Can=
 you get an idea of the actual rate of the keyboard int??????
I think the t=
imers are in millisec, and that would mean this int
happens every 1 millise=
c.  Another theory is it is a 60 Hz int.,
in which case the timers can't be=
 in millisec (I think I verified
they were millisec, but maybe I remember w=
rong???)

> I then put my own version of my keyboard routine in the interru=

You mean in the P3.1 int, not the P3.4 (time16) int, right?

> and fo=
und it was freezing if I call it after toggling that bit. 

Here you mean s=
etting low then high, both, before calling your
keyscan, right???  I probab=
ly used bad terminology when I said
"toggle" in the comments, which I guess=
 really means "invert".

The keyscan interrupt (wh=
ich is a misnomer, it is really time32, 
10 timers, and keyscan interrupt),=
 is written to re-enable ints
inside the ISR (right after inc of time32).  =
I guess the idea is 
to allow the other ints to be serviced before the time=
rs & 
keyscan are done.  This is probably why they leave the out-P3.1
bit l=
ow while servicing int 3.1.  You don't want to get a 
second keyscan int ti=
ll you are done with the current scan.

I don't claim to fully understand h=
ow the interrupts work, 
and I don't know if the ms code is best way to do =
it, but
if it aint broke...

After I wrote my post, I thought on what migh=
t be happening, and 
formed what I figured was a somewhat fair analysis of =
how the 
hardware could be working.  I'm no expert of course, but this is h=
ow 
I'd make it myself, based on what I've seen.  It also matches up with 
=
some of your own hypothesis, but I didn't give you a thorough 
description =
of how exactly I had my interrupt routine setup, which 
I'll explain in a m=
oment, and will hopefully clear up matters a bit.

As for the hardware, I'm=
 thinking that there's a flip-flop in there 
for each interrupt.  When an i=
nterrupt happens, the flip-flop 
enables, and stays on indefinately until i=
t's reset.  I figure all of 
these flip-flop outputs are connected to what =
you read on port 3 
input (so that you can get which interrupt occurred), a=
s well as 
probably all being OR'd together (and inverted) to the processor=
's 
interrupt pin.  During your interrupt routine, you'd then read port 3 
=
to see which interrupt happened, and "acknowledge" it by setting that 
bit =
off then on again, which presumably trips that interrupt's flip-
flop's res=
et.  If you don't trip the reset of the flip-flop(s), it 
won't go off, and=
 therefore make the interrupt routine execute again 
immediately after havi=
ng just executed.

If this is all the case, then I think this is why it was=
 "locking up" 
on me when I wasn't toggling the port 3 output bit.  I say "=
locking 
up" because I had initialization code to fill in the screen with a=
 
particular character, which was directly underneath the code where I 
set=
up my interrupt replacement and enabled interrupts.  The screen 
was drawin=
g only a couple columns or so before just freezing in mid 
draw.  If I wait=
ed until after the screen drawing code to enable 
interrupts, the screen wo=
uld completely draw in just fine, of course, 
but then just freeze afterwar=
ds.  So without toggling that port 3 
bit, it was probably actually just ex=
ecuting the interrupt function 
over and over, and never getting a chance t=
o actually return to my 
main code loop long enough to continue.

What I di=
dn't fully explain about my interrupt routine is that, 
during the initiali=
zation process, I disabled every interrupt in the 
interrupt mask of port 3=
 except for the time16 one.  No keyboard was 
on at this point.  So, when I=
 was re-enabling interrupts at the end 
of my interrupt routine, it would d=
o the freezing up that I mentioned 
earlier.  If I waited to re-enable inte=
rrupts until after I got back 
into my main code loop, then the interrupt w=
ould occur fairly rapidly 
(it didn't fully lock up like before because my =
code had a chance to 
do stuff before the interrupt had a chance to be trig=
gered again, 
which it presumably did immediately upon an EI, since I never=
 toggled 
the p3 bit).  Once I put the port 3 time16 bit toggling into play=
, 
the interrupt started to only happen once a second, which seems to be 
t=
he correct interval of that particular interrupt.

I then turned on the key=
board interrupt in the interrupt mask as 
well, and that's when it started =
to trigger the interrupt routine 
quickly again.  I was pretty much togglin=
g every bit off then on 
again, so that I'd trip all the resets (therefore =
getting both the 
keyboard and time16 in one swoop).  But now I've separate=
d the two 
interrupts out, by detecting which is occuring and jumping to a =

location to deal with it and toggle only its bit, just like the MS is 
doi=
ng (and therefore also implementing an interrupt priority in 
effect, by de=
pending on which I test for first).  That way the code I 
have associated w=
ith the time16 interrupt only runs at its one second 
interval, and the key=
board code executes at its own interval.  

Actually, I'm not doing it EXAC=
TLY like the MS; I'm only executing 
unique code for the time16 and keyboar=
d interrupt.  If one of these 
two doesn't occur, I'm defaulting to togglin=
g all the rest of the 
interrupt bits in one swoop, because I obviously am =
not interested in 
those if they happened to occur.  I turned the others of=
f of course 
in the interrupt mask during initialization, but I figure ther=
e's 
always a chance one could be pending from how the MS had it all 
confi=
gured before I took over.  Just clearing all the others if 
time16 or keybo=
ard doesn't occur prevents another neverending loop, 
like what plagued me =
initially.

Actually, why don't I just show you the code fragment:

	in	a, =
(#03)
	bit	4, a
	jr	nz, interrupt_time16
	bit	1, a
	jr	nz, interrupt_keyboa=
rd
	
	
	ld	a, (p3shadow)	; else, just toggle the bits except 
keyboard and =
time16
	and	a, #12
	out	(#03), a
	ld	a, (p3shadow)
	out	(#03), a
	jr	interr=
upt_end



I think I might be able to measure this keyboard interrupt inter=
val 
by just checking how many keyboard interrupts occur between 
time16's.=
  If I had to make a wild guess, I might say 60 times a 
second, as you sug=
gested.

Do you suppose they use=
 it for tracking the auto power off aspect?

I've pretty much stopped using my own keyscan.  Now that I made=
 the 
one work that I ripped out of the Mailstation firmware, and can make =

my own interrupt as well, I see no reason not to just use theirs, 
since I=
 can relocate the variables required by it to wherever I want, 
without clu=
ttering up C000-FFFF.

But I suppose all the work I put into writing my own=
 version was 
pretty good experience, because it's the first time I've ever=
 worked 
with the raw dealings of rows/columns of a keyboard matrix.

Y=
eah, there's really nothing particularly wrong with the MS interrupt 
that =
I currently know of that would make me not want to use it, it's 
pretty muc=
h solely the fact that its variables are all up in the 
ram.  If I could to=
tally relocate everything, then it'd be pretty 
nice to have one contiguous=
 chunk to work in.

The vars are all set to=
 0 in "init".  

In 2.53yr disassembly, look at 0000:3890, a call to "memfi=
ll" 
that zeroes #C000 thru #FBFF.

"flagz" is also explicitly set to 0 at =
0000:1B75.

I'm gonna make a guess that the reason you need to set
"keycols=
tate" & "keycolstate2" to #FF is because the
real vars are set that way (at=
 least the bits that matter)
when you press the power button to turn ms on.=
  iow,
your keyscan is init after the power has already been
turned on.  Th=
e real keyscan would have seen that
button press and flipped some bits in t=
he real state vars.
Or, maybe all it is seeing is the button release, since=
 that
will happen after the init code runs.  It can't really see
button dow=

I use win 9=
8.  Mailbug 0.0.4 won't work with NT, 2000, or XP, due
to the restriction o=
n port access.  Mailbug 0.0.5 uses the same DLL

now, and I don't know what

e is a LOT that needs 
changing to make it a real windows app.  I have not =
had any time to
tinker with it lately.

I compiled 0.0.4 (and earlier) as d=
os app, because freepascal
did not allow port access in windows, even if yo=
u were running
on win 98.  I don't know if anyone is actually running it un=

dos.  (I really don't think anyone is running it, period.)  It
may not=
 run under dos without changing the default paths & filenames
to 8.3 form. =
 But I would go with win 98.

This does not use the native reflash mode at all.

Mailbug=
 just accesses the addresses in the pattern that unlocks the
flash, writes =
a byte, and watches for the write to complete.  Same 
as if the flash was R=
AM.  Earlier versions loaded the flash
algorithm into ms RAM, and sent it t=
he data to flash.

I removed the actual flash code from the ms side due to =
the
fact that it was too easy to change flash by sending nonsense
bytes.  T=
his happens more often than you might think, when
the ms and mailbug are no=
t in sync.

It is a bit slower now, but not a big deal IMO.  I realize
ther=
e are ways that would make it safer without incurring
as big a speed penalt=
y, but this way struck me as a particularly
easy way to make it safer.

Actually, it is pretty easy to s=

It sounds like your ms app that was interfacing =
with your PC
was canceled by a power-on reset, and the PC kept sending byte=
s
which then were received by the native reflash monitor.  

That checksum =
calc happens *after* it erases and rewrites the

for the operator to read, it has no id=

checksum.

So I made two 16-bit variables (didn't think I needed'em this big, =

kbdtest naturally increments swiftly, but kbdmax settles at =
64 after 
a second or so and stays there.  That would seem to indicate that=
 
it's not 60 times a second after all, but just a tad higher.  Not

the call to the keyboard scan

the keyboard interrupt happens 64 times a second.

Maybe I shoulda waited a little bit before I made th=
at post, because 
here's yet another with some new info!

I decided to use =
this same technique on the other interrupts, to see 
if/when/how often they=
 trigger.  So I implemented code to handle 
every interrupt, and turned the=
m all on.  One by one, I put the code 
to increment kbdtest into the interr=
upt handlers.  Here's what I 
got(2 and 7 being the new ones):

0 - Didn't =
do anything
1 - Triggers 64 times a second, used for keyboard
2 - Triggers =
when a key is pressed (minus power button)
3 - Nothing here
4 - Triggers ev=
ery second
5 - Nada
6 - Zilch
7 - Triggers when power button is pressed/dep=
ressed.  This is 
apparently wired straight to the button, because it somet=
imes 
triggers multiple times when pressed/released (aka not debounced).

I=
 knew there had to be one connected to the power button, because how 
else =
would it wake back up when you press it?  

Interrupt 2 is what surprised m=
e most though: an interrupt that only 
activates from the keyboard, yet the=
y never use it.  I know that to 
do debouncing and such, you'd need a const=
ant time interval, which is 
probably why they chose to do it in interrupt =
1.  Since the MS isn't 
particularly cpu intensive, I guess they figured th=
ey'd just handle 
it all in one swoop each time.  But if one wanted to stre=
amline the 
interrupts, I reckon you could pull the keyboard routines apart=
, and 
save some cycles by only doing some of it when a key is down.

I act=
ually had to edit my post just now.  I initially thought 
interrupt 2 was t=
riggering constantly (64 times a second) as long as 
a key was being held. =
 But then I had a thought about the keyboard 
rows, and what might happen i=
f they were off (aka bits set high).  It 
was then that I remembered that t=
he keyscan was switching these rows 
on and off rapidly (and at a familiar =
64 times a second via interrupt 
1).  So I decided to stop calling keyscan =
in the interrupt routine.  
As a result, interrupt 2 stopped triggering 64 =
times a second when a 
key was being held; instead, it only triggered once =
per button 
press.  If I turn off the keyboard rows, it doesn't trigger an =

interrupt at all.  If I only turn on, say, just the first row, it 
only tr=
iggers when I press one of those buttons.  So interrupt 2 is 
entirely depe=
ndant on which keyboard rows are active.

But if keyscan was toggling all t=
he rows to check them for 
keypresses, and this was causing nonstop interru=
pts on interrupt 2 as 
long as the key was held, then this must mean that t=
oggling a 
keyboard row effectively trips another interrupt 2 if a key in t=
hat 
row is still being held.  This could be useful.  It's actually kind 
o=
f useful just letting it increment 64 times a second when keyscan is 
left =
to run normal, because you could use that as a basis for 
handling key repe=
at and such.

Could it be 62.5????  T=
hat would make time32 exactly in millisec.
Maybe you could measure total co=
unt for 10 or even 60 seconds, and
get aveverage rather than max?  But, I a=
m ready to just call it
milliseconds.  "Close enough for government work", =
as they say.  :-)

Turns out the timers *are* in millisec, too.  Well, they=
 are set in
millisec, that is.

The call to "Set_a_timer(who, msec, persist=
)" takes the number
of msec, and shifts it right 4 bits before sticking it =
in the
timer table.

That explains why time32 increments by 16 each int,
wh=
ile the timers inc by just 1.

The resolution of each of the 10 timers is l=
imited to
multiples of 16 msec,
and the max count is #fff =3D ~65 sec due t=
o fact that
the 16 bit msec param is shifted right by 4 bits.
(Seems upper =
4 bits of 16 bit limit are unsettable.)

So, our current understanding is:
=

- time16 is a 16 bit counter of elapsed seconds since boot,
unknown if it =
is ever used.

- time32 is 32 bit counter of elapsed msec since boot,
units=
 are msec, but resolution is 16 msec.

- the ten event generating timers ar=

milliseconds, but resolution is 16 msec.
Max count is #ff=

Welp, I wante=
d to check, so I set it on 10 seconds first.  After time 
to settle, kbdmax=
 stayed a consistant 640.  So I did the longer test 
of 60 seconds, and got=
 3840.  I tried another different method as 
well (which included waiting u=
ntil after the first time16 before 
starting any counters, to ensure everyt=
hing was in sync), and got the 
same result.  So it seems to confirm the 64=
 times a second I 
initially got.  

So then I thought I should test the ti=
me16 interrupt, just to verify 
that it's in actual exact seconds.  I let i=
t run for about 14 minutes 
counting (14 minutes just because it ended it a=
t the hour mark on the 
clock, easier to remember when to check back on it)=
.  14 minutes =3D 
840 seconds, and this is exactly what my counter said wh=
en it hit the 
hour mark.  Here it is 8 minutes after, and I checked the co=
unter 
again, and it's still accurate.  So time16 interrupt is pretty much =

guaranteed to be in seconds, or it would surely have gotten skewed 
from t=
he clock by now.

So I dunno.  Maybe they don't care about exact millisecon=
ds on the 
Mailstation, and just do it as close as possible.  I doubt it do=
es 
anything particularly time critical in the software in which 
microseco=
nds would matter anyway.

Actually, do you think they might have used this =
time interval due to 
the modem in some way?  I know that you need exact fr=
equencies in 
order to communicate serially without an error percentage.  B=
ut I 
have no idea if the modem chip and cpu run off the same oscillator or=
 
what.  I don't even know what the oscillator speed is.  Obviously 
it's l=
ikely to be some high amount if the Mailstation is capable of 
switching up=
 in speed.

There's three different versions of the modem chip, and I dunno=
 which 
is in the Mailstation without possibly pulling it apart yet again. =
 
One runs at 28.224mhz, one at 52.416mhz, and the other at 56.448mhz.  

B=
ut if we only knew the exact cpu frequency, some math could come 
into play=
 to figure out other things.

That's certainly=
 interesting!  I wonder if it is detecting any
change on keyboard col input=
 port, or just "not #ff" condition.

I don't know about that, it sure seems that the isr associated
=
with int7 is the caller id handler.  

The power button is connected to P9.=
4.  I suppose it *could*
generate interupt on P9.4 low, but then where is t=
he isr???

There doesn't seem to be anything in the isr (labeled
"caller_id=
_handler") to turn on power.  In fact, the first
thing it does is check P2.=
2, which is wired to the data-ready
pin on the caller-id chip.  The isr ret=
s immediately if
there is no data ready.

> I knew there had to be one conn=

I think maybe power button sets the power-control flip-flop=

directly, without cpu's help.  I have to find the drawings I
made (4 years=
 ago, but they are around here somewhere).

I don't really know if the cpu =
is off, or just in halt state
when mailstation is "off" (asleep).  If it is=
 halted, it 
would need an int or a reset to get it started again.

Is ther=
e any possibility that any port bits are getting 
changed accidentally????
=

I am assuming you are using your own shadow vars, right???
What do you ini=
t them to?  (0, or the value of the coresponding
"real" shadow)????

Are yo=
u preventing *all* of the original int code from running?

Perhaps it *is* used, to wake up fro=
m a "screensaver" mode
where unit goes to sleep, but needs to wake up right=
 where you
left off?  I don't know if the mailstation even has this mode, 
=
though.  The isr would not need to do anything, just the int
would restart =
halted cpu.

Mebbe we sh=

Probably the slowest!  (cheaper)
OK, I looked at mine, t=

"524AS9X", and I am gonna jump to conclusio=

I don't think cp=
u freq has anything to do with modem or timers.
The RTC has it's own xtal, =
too.  (rtc stops if you short it out).

X101 (cpu xtal) has number "122AS9Y=
" which I am assuming means 
12.2 MHz.

X102 (rtc xtal) has no number (that=
 I can see, at least).

I stripped everything out and made a standalone interrupt 7 test, if 
you =
want to try it yourself.  This will make the LED come on when you 
press th=
e power button:

I tested this finally to see just what happens.  I pulle=

powerdown function out and changed it so that it would jump to the 
=
beginning of my code after the halt.  If the processor was merely 
asleep, =

So it m=

completely kill the p=
ower to the cpu, or at least maybe somehow holds 
it in a state of reset.

However!  We can make our own "sleep" mode.  Upon getting a power 
button p=

unmask all of t=
hem except like 2 (a keypress interrupt), turn off the 
lcd, re-enable inte=

the halt we just put a jum=
p to where we want to go when it wakes up.  
I just tried it, and it works =
like a charm!  It woke right back up 
and went back to my code.  I also tri=

Yep, as can be seen in the test app above.




Here's y=
ou something kind of interesting.  The v2.53 powerdown at 
#1AC0:

di      =
    
ld a,(p28shadow) ;; set p28.0  either modem reset, or I am a pin off 
=
on Vcc control bit?????
set 0,a     ;; Yeah, this makes more sense as "powe=
r off"
ld b,a      
out (28),a  
ld de,03E8  
push de    
call Delay(msec) =
  ;; delay
pop de      
ld a,b      ;; reset p28.0
res 0,a    
out (28),a  =

halt        ;; stop cpu.  interrupts can wake it, I guess.
ret


And now t=
he v3.03a powerdown:

di      
ld      a,(p28shadow)
set     0,a
ld      b,=
a
out     (#28),a
halt    
ret     


No delay, no other bit resets or anyt=
hing.  Just straight and to the 
point.  Wonder what the delay and other st=
uff is for, then?

OK, I am getting int7 t=
oo when I run your test.  I wonder if
anything else triggers int7?  Does th=
e callerid chip?

The isr sure looks like it is caller-id related.  And it =
most
definitely does not turn the power on.  Or off.

I did some poking aro=
und with continuity checker tonight.
There are three things that set the po=
wer flip-flop to the
"on" state:  Power button, reset button, and a pin on =
cpu.

The two buttons can pull the /set pin of the f-f to ground 
via two d=
iodes.  The pin from cpu chip is connected to /set
thru a 10k resistor.

Hmmmm... =
 I wonder if they decided it works better that way?
It almost seems like a =
waste of time to take the delay out,
even if it is not needed.

What PCB is=

I actually made my test program because I honestly did=
n't know if 
your MS might behave differently.

I've never doubted your ass=
umption of interrupt 7 being used for 
caller id though, especially after h=
aving looked at the function the 
interrupt routine is calling.  It's just =
that the same interrupt 
obviously has a second and unexpected use.  Whethe=
r they actually 
actively use it though is another story, and at the moment=
, I'd lean 
towards "no".  Much like with interrupt 2.  It makes me wonder =
how 
many other aspects of the device have multiple and/or unused 
function=
s.

The thing is though, I'm fairly sure my model doesn't have caller ID 
(=
as with all DET1 models, correct?).  So I wonder if the models that 
do hav=
e caller id still have the power button associated with their 
interrupt 7?=
  

I wonder if maybe they tied the power button to it on these earlier 
mo=
dels just for testing purposes?  That, or maybe they actually 
thought they=
'd use it in early planning stages, until they changed 
their minds, and de=
cided to use it for caller ID instead.  This is 
the version 2.xx and 3.xx =
firmware after all.  Who knows what was in 
earlier revisions.

Have you tr=
ied tracing that interrupt's pin off the cpu to see where 
all it goes?

Well look at that, it does come on when =
I press reset!  Is the pin on 
the cpu you're referring to the P28.0 one?

It's black, th=

So while we have some very detailed info on many of the Mailstation 
ports,=
 there's still a lot we don't know.  So I decided to just poke 
around, and=
 found a bit of stuff that was interesting, and some not 
so much, but coul=
d lead to more later.  HERE GOES:


These three ports were assumed to contr=
ol the RTC, but I'm thinking 
they control a hardware timer.

Port #1d
 - S=
etting bit 2 triggers interrupt 5 (not sure why yet)
 - Setting port to #FF=
 only reads back as #0F

Port #1e
 - Set to #FF returns 0

Port #1f
 - Sett=
ing bit 1 freezes Mailstation (endless interrupt?)

After finding out that =
I could make very high-speed interrupt 5's 
happen by fiddling around with =
#1d and #1f, I looked in the 
Mailstation code, and they used some similar =
code to what I was doing 
to make it happen:
	
xor	a
set	2, a
out	(#1d), a
=
ld	a, #0e	
out	(#1f), a
ld	a, #0c	
out	(#1f), a

With this, interrupt 5 hap=
pens repeatedly, and much faster than the 
keyboard interrupt (which happen=
s 64 times a second), but I couldn't 
measure it because time16 apparently =
stops working when this is in 
progress.  I tried to measure it inside the =
keyboard interrupt, but 
it seemed to fluctuate so much that I couldn't get=
 a result.  I'm not 
sure if that's due to the interrupt itself fluctuating=
, or perhaps 
the cpu not being able to keep up to get a proper measurement=
.

However, I think that you're supposed to set an interval for this 
someh=
ow.  Maybe there's a bit somewhere that possibly makes P10-P1C 
set timer l=
ength instead of RTC?



Port #0b
 - Clearing bit 3 distorts the lcd in var=
ious ways, and makes it seem 
to draw certain columns in different places t=
han usual.  Bits 0-2 
seem to affect how it does this.  I have no idea what=
 this is doing 
at the moment, but it makes the LCD pretty much unusable.
 =
- Clearing bit 7 turns off LCD


Port #0d (CPU clock rate control)
 - Setti=
ng bits 0-2 makes it run noticably slow.  Variations seem to 
make it simil=
arly slow.  I'm positive that this is slower than 8mhz.  
Could be 4, or ev=
en less.  I'd have to come up with some sort of test.


Port #2f
 - Setting=
 bit 2 makes odd speaker noise + LED flicker (I thought I 
clocked somethin=
g too high and burned up a chip or something at 
first!)
 - Setting bits 4,=
6 makes time16 interrupt 2x slower (kbdmax =3D 128)
 - Setting bits 5,6 mak=
es time16 interrupt 4x slower (kbdmax =3D 256)
 - Setting bits 4,5,6 makes =
time16 interrupt 8x slower (kbdmax =3D 512)
 - When bit 6 is clear, but 4, =
5, or both are set, time16 interrupt 
doesn't seem to ever occur.

kbdmax i=
s the variable I used before to detect how many times 
interrupt 1 (keyboar=
d handler) occurred in between time16's.  
Normally, kbdmax has a value of =
64 when a time16 interrupt occurs, 
just for reference with the above.

The=
 following info regarding port #2f was found in codeflash page 3, 
in a fun=
ction at #4349:
 - Bits 6,7 are enabled by firmware when it sets the port
 =
- Bits 0-2 are cleared by firmware when it sets the port
 - Bit 3 is passed=
 along from p2Fshadow

So basically, 11xxc000, where xx bits controls how m=
uch to slow down 
time16, while c is unknown to me.  I'm not even sure what=
 use this 
port is, since changing the cpu speed doesn't seem to affect the=
 
interrupt speeds.



Here's some slightly useless info for the moment, bu=
t it shows that 
some of these are quite possibly used for something:

Port=
 #0c
 - Setting #00 returns #05
 - setting #FF returns #E3

Port #20
 - Set=
ting #FF returns #40

Port #29
 - Setting #FF returns #0F


These seem enti=
rely useless:

Ports #04, #22-27, #2a, #2b, #2e
 - Setting #FF returns #00
=


And these seem to just not be connected to anything at all:

#30 - #50
 -=
 returns value of port itself

I stopped testing at #50, but I assume all t=
he rest to #FF do the same

 (as with all DET1 models, correct?).  

AFAIK only the eMessage had caller=
-id function.  DET1 covers
a whole bunch of different models, so it really =
is not very
useful as an identifier.  All the brown & white mailstations,
a=
nd the emessage are "DET1".  

The first ergonomic case model was called DE=
T2 (purple mivo 200).
The 250's are DET2B, the 350 is IWT2B.

Now, everythi=
ng else (the "AFAIK is still in effect) is a DET1x,
where the x is a letter=
.  This includes both old and new 120, and
both old and new 150.  Also, I t=
hink one of the older models was
"DET1-01".  And it makes a difference wher=
e you look for number.
The older 120 says DET2 on bottom of unit, but DET1E=
 on the box!

I have a white "mailstation" (came in box with brown picture,=
 and
a sticker that said "new color!".  It has same PCB as the eMessages,
w=
ith caller-id chip, but no caller-id function.  I'm as sure as I
need to be=
 that it is really a reflashed eMessage.  The oddest
part is that it has sa=
me firmware version # (3.03a) as your black
unit, which doesn't have caller=
-id chip.  (is yours really very 
dark brown???) 

The PCB in brown units (=
1T0863BMB-33)is different than the white
(1T0863CMB-32) mainly in that ther=
e is no caller-id chip.

2.53yr (brown, no chip) still has the caller-id is=
r.  I took a
quick look at your 3.03a dump, and it seems to have same isr.

The cpu is same in all of =

Earliest I have seen is 2.21 (eM=

I think int is associated with an i/o bit, (or bits,=
 it seems).
Power button is on P9.4 ,and my best guess is call-id int is
on=
 P2.2 (callid_data_rdy).

No, P28.0 is an output, and it *clears=
" power f-f, turning 
power off.

I don't think the signal that turns power=
 on is a port bit, 
rather the "alarm" out from rtc.  Just a guess, though.=

If cpu is off, then ports prolly don't work.  I am assuming
that rtc insid=
e cpu is powered, even when rest of chip is
off.  It has to keep time/date =
counting, even when off.
My guess is they use a timer to wake unit up at ma=
il check 
time. 

I think maybe reason it comes on with reset button might =

have to do with reflashing in the box.  Brown units at 
least.  They had h=
oles in the inner box giving access to 
power jack, par port, and reset but=
ton.

I don't have a box or anythin=

unfortunately.  It does also say "REN: 0.1B=

I've never considered it dark brown, it truly l=
ooks black to me, but 
I dunno.  I can't even really capture the color well=
 enough with a 
camera, but I tried: http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/
=
ms_front1.jpg

Odd thing happened with the LCD there.  Guess the camera is =
faster 
than the LCD refresh.  

As for the content on the screen, that's w=
here I'm testing C code.  I 
finally figured out SDCC enough to modify its =
CRT0.s to work with my 
app loader (since code starts at 0x8000 after loadi=
ng), and then 
added in my text lcd functionality by replacing their placeh=
older 
'putchar' with my own (which uses global cursorx and cursory 
variab=
les accessable from C, as well as being capable of interpreting 
carriage r=
eturns/line feeds), which is the most basic function of all 
of C's charact=
er and string drawing functions.  So now I can use 
printf and such to outp=
ut text, which is so much less time consuming 
than fiddling around in asse=
mbly.  I've implemented a few basic 
functions in actual C, like for cleari=
ng the screen and getting 
scancodes, but that really needs to be redone in=
 assembly.  I've 
already done those things in assembly before, it's mostly=
 a matter of 
modifying the code to work with SDCC.  Unfortunately code I m=
ake now 
is certainly more bulky with all of C's libraries crammed in, and =

things are a bit more noticably slow from the overhead.

One problem I hav=
e with SDCC is that I have no idea how to align data 
by a particular amoun=
t of bytes!  In AS80, I have my cga font table 
aligned to a 256 byte area,=
 so that the font drawing code works 
quickly.  But now I have to specifica=
lly 'org' the code to a location 
in order to make it work.  I really don't=
 know if SDCC can even do 
it, which is a huge downside.  For now, I'm just=
 putting the 2k of 
font data at the very end of page8000 to avoid messing =
with the 
memory areas C uses, which makes all my binaries 16kb.

Anyhoo, w=
hen I have more functionality worked in for at least 
handling the keyboard=
 properly with standard C functions, I'll upload 
some stuff.

It's a=
 Sony Cybershot 3.2 megapixel that I found on sale a year or 
two ago.  It'=
s a good camera for the most part, and has a macro mode 
for when you want =
to get close to things.  But you can't turn off the 
flash without going in=
to slow exposure, which is pretty useless 
unless you have it on a stand.  =
So I always manage to kill most up-
close pictures with the flash, or take =
a bunch until I get one that 
I'm somewhat satisfied with.  I had to block =
out some of the light 
with paper just for those I took of the MS board.

I=
 thought about using a scanner actually, but then I figured it'd 
prolly be=
 kind of hard to position it on there without taking the 
whole board out.

If you're running from RAM, instead of 256 byte table, allocate an
extra 256 bytes before or after.

Them memmove the table data to the aligned location at runtime calculated by:

U = table address
A = (U + 0xFF) & 0xFF00

You will "waste" 256 bytes using this method. However, either above or
below the table you will have at least 128 bytes, so you may be able
to find some other purpose for it.

If you are running from flash, you could allocate 256 bytes and then
attempt to realloc only as many bytes as a you need to get an aligned
chunk in there somewhere. Probably the allocator will not change the
location, but you need to verify that the address does not change.

Hey that's a pr=
etty clever method.  After I wrote my last post, I 
stopped wasting so much=
 space in the binary by moving it to the last 
2k of slot8000 ram during C'=
s initialization, but that was still 
wasting ram by leaving it in the orig=
inal position too.  This method 
is much better, and only takes four lines =
more assembly than the 
previous method to find the new address.  So 8 line=
s total, plus a 
variable now to store the address.  Not quite as clean as =
using a 
simple "align 256" in AS80, but it works.

Yeah it'd be a little bit trick=
ier if I were using rom, which 
fortunately I'm not at the moment.  But I c=
ould probably write a 
little app in C or Perl or something to read the sym=
bols file SDCC 
produces to get the offsets, then shift the font data aroun=
d to be 
aligned, and then also change a location that pointed to the font =

data position.

I found the other day that I could look at the symbols fil=
e and use a 
calculator to manually pad the area above the font data, but i=
t meant 
updating the padding value fairly often while I was working on it.=
  
But I suppose that once I got all that code squared away, it'd be a 
sim=
ple method to do the job, without wasting any more bytes than 
necessary.

=
Actually, now that I think about it, I could probably whip together a 
Perl=
 script that could read the symbols file, then rewrite a one-line 
include =
file with the number of padding bytes I need to align the 
font data, then =
have it recompile again.

Anyhoo I'm just rambling now, so thanks for the t=
ips!

That would work. That would get you to an average case of 128 bytes
lost instead of 256.  Worst case is 255 I guess.

A word of advice from another Perl programmer: 'use bytes;'

Perl will by a set of defined rules but which to me looks like magic
spontaneously decide to consider a string as Unicode. Try to unpack
that beastie, and hilarity ensues. Data::HexDump will show it as it
is, but unpack will do some translations you don't expect.

So if you are doing a lot of binary manipulation but you don't care
about unicode, just use bytes; and the problem will not appear.

(I learned this recently... I know, very reasonable engineers will
ignore this advice right up until it kicks them in the butt... I
probably would ignore it myself.)


Keep up the good work here... with a reasonable C environment I may
have to dust off my mailstation too :-) It would be fun to boot ZCN or
CP/M on the MS. I also have on my "one of these days" projects
transplanting a MS PCB and display into a Tandy 102 case. The T102's
ROM chip is based on 8085, a much simpler offshoot of the 8080 than
the Z80, so it might be possible to port that ROM over.

This is far from an actual OS just yet, but I made considerable 
strides no=
w that I have full I/O in C, and made a pretty decent 
command-line interfa=
ce to do some various tasks.  I haven't touched 
up the source to everythin=
g just enough yet to release that, but I 
thought I'd let folks test the bi=
nary to see if there's anything I 
might need to do before I release anythi=
ng else.  Plus I just think 
it's kind of neat to play with!

So let me jus=
t get to the link, first of all:
http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/fyos_=
001.bin

You need a loader app already, which is outside of the scope of th=
is 
particular post.  I might write up some documentation on that aspect 
a=
nd include a loader app when I release the full source.  But for the 
time =
being, this assumes you're using something or other that gets a 
binary fil=
e into ram at 0x8000, and executes it.  It also expects to 
have interrupts=
 enabled when it starts.

Now I know there's a few different firmware versi=
ons floating around 
out there, but one of the neater aspects is that I wro=
te support into 
CRT0 initialization to detect the firmware version and dyn=
amically 
fill in the shadow vars (I only use p2 and p3 shadow for now).  T=
his 
means it SHOULD support v2.53, v2.54, and v3.03 just fine, despite 
ea=
ch being different.  But I've only tested it on v3.03, because 
that's the =
only MS I have.

When it loads up, you get some info where it shows the fir=
mware 
version, tells you if it's satisfied with that version (and what 
fa=
llback it used if not), then shows some other stuff.  One is where 
I was t=
esting to verify globals were being initialized, which 
probably isn't need=
ed anymore.  The shadow byte addresses should help 
you verify if it's usin=
g the proper ones.  And cgafont_addr is just 
for reference, and probably i=
sn't really needed anymore either.

Then you get a > (unfortunately no blin=
king cursor yet), where you 
type in commands.  To get a list, use "help". =
 Case insensitive.

You have:

CLS - Clears the screen.
EXIT - Launches ori=
ginal page4000 loader (in case you want to reload 
it or other code, which =
I do often for testing).
HELP - Gets help on individual commands.
HEXTOINT =
- Displays hex strings as integers.  Was used to test a 
function I wrote t=
o do this, but I left the command in anyway.
PEEK - Displays memory locatio=
ns in hex.
POKE - Writes a byte to a memory location.
RESET - Resets FyOS t=
o initial screen.
REBOOT - Resets the Mailstation to 0x0000.
POWERDOWN - Tu=
rns off the Mailstation via firmware function 0x0A6B.

The screen will scro=
ll downwards when you reach the bottom, just like 
any other text screen.  =
Text wraps around the right edge.  Backspace 
goes past the left edge to th=
e previous line (unless at line 0).  The 
text I/O is really pretty nifty i=
f I do say so myself.

Not all of the code is optimized yet, some of which =
still being 
written in C functions.  Some of the assembly could be written=
 in a 
better manner, as well.  But hey, it works.  I'd rather focus on 
fu=
nctionality than speed at the moment.

I should point out that I am NOT usi=
ng a custom interrupt here.  I'm 
not using custom keyboard functions or an=
y of that.  This is working 
purely off the Mailstation firmware, which is =
why it was important to 
use the proper shadow vars.  To get a blinking cur=
sor though, I may 
have to hook the interrupt sometime.

I can't think of a=
nything else in particular to mention about it, so 
I hope it works on othe=
r Mailstations!

Welp, I finished a whole bunch of documenation, commented my source 
files,=
 and included the tools I use (short of SDCC itself), all in 
one zip file.=
  If you have a PC and a Mailstation, then you should be 
able to use this =
I hope!

http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/fyos_c_002.zip

Check out the=
 readme.txt first.


It's actually v0.02 of FyOS included this time, instea=
d of simply the 
source to v0.01.  I made a bunch of changes to the code, a=
nd since 
the FyOS command interpreter basically makes for a big example of=
 how 
to use this stuff, I figured it only made sense to go ahead and 
incl=
ude the newest.  I included a binary version too if you want to 
get right =
to playing with it.

Version 0.02 has a lot of optimizations (particularly =
in screen 
scrolling and clearing), as well as some additional commands, li=
ke to 
poke and peek values into ports now (since before you could only do =

memory locations).  There's also an interactive scancode viewer.

I includ=
ed the binary to v0.01 too if anyone wants to compare the 
two.  This might=
 give you an idea of how writing code in C will 
perform as opposed to asse=
mbly.  Screen scrolling and clearing is 
particularly noticable between the=
 two.

Unfortunately, it's starting to get pretty fat already!  I'm going t=
o 
have to figure out an alternative storage method.  I have some things 
i=
n mind though.


But yeah, FyOS aside, you should be able to just write you=
r own apps 
fairly easily now I hope.  There's hardly any difference in wri=
ting 
for the Mailstation as to just a normal console window in DOS or 
Lin=
ux, to be honest.  printf/getchar/gets are the most used functions 
for con=
sole interaction that I know of, and they work fine with no 
setup necessar=
y by the user.  Only thing you truly have to worry 
about is your code and =
data sizes, since the MS can only hold so much.

As always, let me know if =
you have any problems or questions.

Forget what I said here about b=
its 0-2 affecting what bit 3 does, 
because I don't really believe that for=
 sure now.  Particularly since 
I discovered what bits 0 and 1 are doing, a=
t least.

When I disable bit 0, keys on keyboard row 8 stop responding.  No=
w of 
course my determination of them not responding is whether the MS 
key=
scan function via the interrupt returns anything from them.  Since 
it's fl=
ipping the rows on and off and such, who knows how that could 
interact wit=
h what bit 0 is doing here.

When I disable bit 1, keyboard row 9 stops res=
ponding.  Again, a more 
conclusive test would have to be done as to whethe=
r it's entirely 
killing that keyboard row, but it certainly stops working =
in my 
initial test.

Bit 2 doesn't seem to have any effect on the keyboard=
.

Bit 3 still causes the screen to go wonky.

Bit 7 still causes the LCD g=
o off.

Then I realized, where does this sound familiar?  Yep, port 2!  I 
=
thought maybe this was just a mirror of that port.  Bits 0, 1, and 7 
certa=
inly seem similar in function.  But no, when I tried to enable 
the LED via=
 bit 4, it didn't work.  I even tried a direct test with 
interrupts disabl=
ed, in case it was flipping the bit around in the 
interrupt too fast to se=
e if the light was on.  It never came on, no 
matter which way I set the bi=
t.

So I dunno really.  Reading back port 0x02 while FyOS is running 
shows=
 me 0xac, while reading back 0x0b gives 0xff.  Maybe they're not 
as relate=
d as I thought.  But it certainly seems to have some similar-

There is speculation found =
here

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mailstation/files/part%20files/RSD=
RD_3SI176_0A.txt

that port #0B is the DDR for port #02.

Keep in mind that=
 you can't necessarily expect to be able to
read back the last value you se=
nt to a port.  Sometimes the 
"in" and "out" for a particular port address =
are even used for
different functions, such as with port #01, where "out" d=
rives
the keyboard rows, but "in" reads the keyboard columns.

That's why t=
hey keep all those "shadow" vars.

Not posted here lately, but I've been working nonetheless!  I made a 
ton o=
f internal changes, so I went from v0.02 to just making this 
v0.1.  The so=
urce is still messy though so I'm only going to release 
a binary as a prev=
iew.  It not only needs more comments, but still 
needs some work to make i=
t easier to access from outside code.  In 
other words, by the time I relea=
se the source next time, it'll likely 
have an actual programming interface=
 similar to CP/M's BDOS 
functionality.

http://www.fybertech.net/mailstati=
on/fyos_01_ldr.bin


The big internal changes are:

 - Interrupt has been f=
ully replaced.  This means the firmware's 
keyboard routines were ripped ou=
t to be loaded from elsewhere, and to 
also use variables in different loca=
tions.  This was necessary 
because...

 - I added in key repeat.

 - And a=
n actual blinking cursor.  

 - Replacing the interrupt meant I was no long=
er tied to using the 
firmware's p2shadow and p3shadow.  In other words, th=
is should run on 
any version of the firmware, since I'm no longer using an=
y firmware 
routines.  And I created my own shadow vars.

 - The entire thi=
ng now runs from the upper 16K of ram.  The command 
interpreter starts at =
0xc000, and the "BDOS" starts at 0xe400.  The 
command interpreter is prett=
y fat right now, since it's all written 
in C.  It was all I could do to ma=
ke it fit in that space, and I had 
to remove a couple of the help commands=
 to do that!  The "BDOS" is 
all assembly.


Since the code starts at 0xc00=
0 (though initially executed at 
0xe400), I tacked it onto the end of a tin=
y loader.  So you can still 
load the binary at the normal 0x8000, and once=
 it runs, it'll take 
care of moving the code into the right place and exec=
uting it.

I have to say, the addition of a blinking cursor makes it look m=
uch 
more alive now than it has nearly the entire time I've worked on all 
=
this.  It was certainly worth the effort involved.  For all intents 
and pu=
rposes, it's now about as close to a true text console as one 
can get.

I =
don't know how many people actually have tried any of the other 
versions, =
but I hope you like this one!  And if you don't know how to 
load it, there=
's instructions and software in the v0.02 zip to let 
you do so.


Also, in=
 a funny twist, it seems that there's a perfect sequence of 
bytes somewher=
e in my code/data which makes the Mailstation think it 
was shut down prope=
rly when you hit the reset button on the back.

How hard do you suppose it would be to make the first 16KB of address 
spac=
e swappable, like the middle two "slots" can do?  I haven't gone 
over the =
circuits hardly at all so I don't know really what does what 
at the moment=
.  But if it wasn't too elaborate, and one could take 
advantage of some sp=
are port or something like that, it might be 
worth trying.  Even if I had =
to hard-wire the page of ram it went to, 
that'd be okay too.  And I know t=
here's some undocumented pins on the 
CPU still.

In FyOS, I've written in =
compatibility for almost all of CP/M's BDOS 
function calls except file ope=
rations.  Eventually I want to get that 
too.  But the point is, most CP/M =
apps naturally expect to run from 
0x0100.  They call 0x0005 for BDOS funct=
ions.  These two aspects 
alone aren't TOO bad; I mean, with a little work,=
 one could relocate 
a program to run at 0x4000 instead (which I've been do=
ing to one for 
testing purposes)

But obviously there's much more than sim=
ple relocation most times, 
since various apps can have hard-coded memory l=
ocations and routines 
that do things in places that'd require digging real=
ly deep in the 
code, and truly learning what every aspect of the code is d=
oing.  A 
very time consuming and outright confusing chore at times.

So, o=
bviously, I opt to take the easy way out if possible!  I'm not 
calling any=
 firmware functions at all, so I don't need anything from 
the first 16KB o=
f address space once FyOS is running.  If I could 
just swap ram there, it =
would be a much more functional system.  So 
I'm mostly wondering if anyone=
 has examined the hardware enough to 
determine if this is very possible?

Hi, a number of times i read that you have storage problems with the
mailst=
ation, maybe my suggestion is not applicable or already
considered but, why=
 not use the 8 megabits flash memory that the
mailstation uses to save e-ma=
ils and CFG files, to store the FS and/or
the program data? it's not a HUGE=
 amount of memory but, 1MB is 1MB.

Or you can try using a IDE device for storage, like a CF card (A bit
diffic=
ult because of the connector) or a notebook HDD.

Take a look at:

There were a couple of prob=
lems with using the flash memory.  At 
least in my mind.  The codeflash was=
 the larger one, and I didn't 
really want to mess with it for the time bei=
ng.  Especially since 
it's broken up into 64KB sectors, meaning you have t=
o erase the whole 
chunk to change anything in it.  The dataflash is only 5=
12KB, but has 
256 byte sectors, which is much better for storing data.  Ho=
wever, 
they chose to use one with far less write cycles than even the 
cod=
eflash.  So after some extended use, you'd eventually start 
wearing it dow=
n to the point that it wouldn't work anymore.  

So that leads me to the pr=
oblem of making some sort of file system 
out of it that limits how much it=
 writes to particular sectors.  For 
my little Fonera router thing that I r=
eflashed a while back, it uses 
JFFS to deal with the flash memory, to writ=
e to it in kind of a 
circular loop, to extend the flash's life as long as =
possible.  But 
the problem is that that method is more memory-intensive an=
d slow, 
and I think that's the last thing the Mailstation needs to contend=
 
with.  The Fonera has much more horsepower to deal with it.

I considered=
 compact flash once (which is nearly identical to IDE), 
but that would req=
uire an actual hardware mod, and I've always wanted 
to keep this stuff as =
casual hobbyist friendly as possible.  Plus I 
didn't particularly want to =
risk the Mailstation itself for modding.  
That's why I thought of trying t=
o use SD over the parallel port of 
the thing.  That'd be slow, but it woul=
d work.  It's just a matter of 
making some little adapter.  Such a thing w=
ould also have to adapt 
the 5v to 3.3v.  And I'm lazy and never did it!

I=
n the end though, it will probably come down to some sort of 
internal flas=
h storage.  I'll try to do some reading on what other 
people have done wit=
h other devices and see if I can get some idears, 
to avoid wearing the fla=
sh down as much as possible.  It's just one 
of those things where I'm stil=
l at the stage where it's daunting to 
think about.

I need to look in my van to see if my mailstations are still there or
if th=
ey ended up at goodwill.  If they are, I'll try to load the new
OS files an=
d play around some.

I was reading your livejournal and am impressed :-) bu=
t since I'm not
a c coder and only know that cp/m preceded ms-dos (well, ov=
erlapped
some, IIRC) what can I expect to do with it?  Maybe if I list some=

things, you can tell me if they are ever remotely possible?

- Simple memo=
ry games or flashcards for the kids?  
- Pull weather, headlines, whatever =
from a direct connected
internet-enabled pc?  (Along the lines of ybox?)
- =
Smart Keyboard for a pda with a serial connection?
- Dumb terminal for a se=
rver box?

From what you've written, they don't seem totally impossible. I =
really
like the idea of using a MS like this:

http://www.jtsystem.ca/touch=
amp.htm

Of course, I know that the Palm OS has a lot more memory available=
 but
the serial connection to the WinAmp machine is cool.

----

One thing =
that I've always thought would make the MS useable as is, if
I could use a =
null modem connection to put any text I'd written onto
my main pc.  You see=
m to be able to talk to the unit, so is that
something you could document h=
ow to do?  I do have an old external
modem and null modem adapter.  I even =
have an ancient parallel port
external hard drive that I could dig out and =
use.       

Anyway, thanks for sharing all your work!

Terry

Well if I could put a=
ctual CP/M on it, there'd be lots of 
applications that could be run native=
ly.  The problem is the memory 
layout of the Mailstation, and how CP/M and=
 applications compiled for 
it expect a slightly different memory layout.  =
Changing it would 
require a hardware modification to the unit, which is pr=
obably above 
the head of most casual Mailstation modders.  Possibly above =
mine as 
well, considering the small traces on the board involved in doing =
it!

That's pretty much why I was working on FyOS, which would be similar 
=
to CP/M, but unfortunately not be compatible with its applications.  
Possi=
ble exceptions might be in cases where the source code to one 
might be ava=
ilable and easily modifiable.  Ones without source just 
seem too hard to d=
o anything with.  I tried to decompile and modify 
Zork, for example, but o=
nce I started going into the assembly code 
and realizing just what a job t=
hat would be, just for one program, I 
found it just wasn't viable.  I was =
having to completely learn what 
every bit of the code did before I could e=
ven begin modifying it, and 
considering it was all in assembly, that's a b=
it hard.

Most applications for FyOS would probably have to be written by m=
e or 
someone else who learned the ins and outs.  But since I figured out 
=
how to compile things in C for it, there might be a few folks who 
could do=
 it once I had a better version of FyOS out.  When I last 
worked on it, I =
was still at the stage of developing a storage 
method, which would be a pr=
etty important part to being able to have 
applications on there.  At the m=
oment, people can write programs in C 
with what I've done so far, but they=
'd still have to be transferred 
individually.

You made some pretty good s=
uggestions though of the sorts of programs 
that I too would like to see.  =
One being something like a PDA 
keyboard, since I type pretty quick on the =
PC, and it's extremely 
limiting to try and peck stuff out on a PDA screen'=
s keyboard.  I 
think my Palm would be a much more useful tool if I could u=
se the 
Mailstation to type stuff into it.  

The other good suggestion is =
the dumb terminal.  I run one particular 
server completely headless, and i=
t would be handy to be able to 
interface it directly without having to SSH=
 in from elsewhere at 
times.  I also have one of those Fonera router thing=
s which runs 
Linux, and think it would be neat to interface the Mailstatio=
n with 
it, giving the Fonera (which has wifi) a keyboard and screen to wor=
k 
with.  With a battery pack, the Fonera could be mobile, since it's so 
s=
mall.

The problem with making any sort of serial connection though is the =

lack of a serial port.  The Mailstation uses a modem chip, which 
unfortun=
ately directly outputs to a phone line.  I haven't looked 
over the datashe=
et for the chip very thoroughly, so I don't know if 
it might have any pins=
 to tap into the serial port of it directly, 
but even if one could, solder=
ing onto those pins would be extremely 
tricky.  The other alternative is u=
sing the parallel port of the 
Mailstation to emulate a serial port, which =
would require very 
precise programming to time the speed of a serial data.=
  It would 
probably also require a bit of hardware to be plugged between t=
he MS 
and PC, to convert the signals from the parallel port into the 
volt=
ages that a serial port wants.  I've managed to get away without 
such conv=
ersions in the past on other projects, but that only worked 
when talking t=
o my laptop's serial port, and not on my desktop 
machine.

I have kind of =
made a dumb terminal to my PC before in a way, by 
writing some software to=
 send keystrokes to the computer, then send 
them to an IRC chat room, and =
then send any output from chat back to 
the Mailstation screen.  This was a=
ll done through the parallel 
laplink cable though that I use to load FyOS.=
  One could probably do 
something similar with a Linux machine for an actu=
al terminal, but it 
wouldn't be as simple to setup as just a serial connec=
tion.

But yeah, I think perhaps trying to emulate the serial port is 
prob=
ably something good to try sometime.  With that, it would open up 
a few po=
ssibilities in general.  I'm just not sure if I have any of 
the chips arou=
nd to do the serial conversion at the moment for 
testing.

Jeff, I would like to thank you for all the work you have done on 
this pro=
ject !!!

Were you able to find out what the internal modem had for 
parame=
ters ??  Baud rate, parity ???

Also is there some pin on the serial/parall=
el port that could be used 
as a PTT/transmit pinout when the modem goes in=
to transmit mode ??

My thinking is to use this as a dumb data terminal in =
a mobile sense, 
connecting to some 2 way radio units.

Thanks,
Wayne

Different model Mailstations appear to have different=
 modem speeds.  
There's a list in the Database section of the group here. =
 The one 
mine uses though is 33.6kbps, using the chip RCV336ACFW/SP.  Ther=
e's 
a datasheet for it in the Files section here, in the "part files" 
dir=
ectory, if you understand electronics enough to look over it.  I 
would ass=
ume it defaults to 8-N-1 parity, but I have no idea.  I've 
never written a=
ny code to access it myself as of this time.

The modem chip itself might activate some pins when it's usin=
g the 
modem, but I haven't read the datasheet in any detail to know.  It'd=
 
be hard to take advantage of that anyway since the pins are so tiny 
on t=
hat chip.  

That's an interesting concept though.  I honestly have never w=
orked 
with any sort of half-duplex audio equipment with a data connection,=
 
but I assume it can be done.  I don't think a standard modem would 
work,=
 however, since as far as I know, it requires full-duplex, 
particularly to=
 negotiate the connection, but to maintain it as well.

The only thing I ca=
n figure that you could do would be to use some 
sort of external hardware =
to modulate data into something that could 
transmit via audio, and use the=
 Mailstation's parallel port to talk 
to that device.  Not exactly what you=
 had in mind I guess, but that's 
the only way I can figure that it could b=
e done.  I don't know enough 
about that sort of thing to know what sort of=
 device you'd need for 
it.

I thought I'd make a new topic regarding this, since I don't think 
it's be=
en discussed before.

Basically, I want to figure out the data structure of=
 the email 
stored in the dataflash.  I haven't investigated it thoroughly =
yet, 
but I thought I'd post my preliminary findings, and perhaps see if 
s=
omeone else might have learned more about it already before I spend 
any ti=
me trying to figure it out.

Here's what I've found so far.  Messages seem =
to start with a 14 byte 
header, the first of which tends to always be 0xfd=
.  It's followed by 
the subject line, null terminated, but the field alway=
s appears to be 
142 bytes long, regardless of how short the subject really=
 is.  After 
that is the email recipient, immediately terminated by a null.=
  Then 
the message body, also terminated by null.  Then I think there's an=
 8 
byte footer of data.  

I've been doing various dumps after creating em=
ails and such to 
compare the data.  I think the second byte of the email h=
eaders 
possibly determines the status in some way, such as if it's deleted=
 
or whatnot.

I'd like to find an index or something, but I'm not sure if =
one 
exists.  Perhaps it just reads through them all and constructs and 
in=
dex in memory.

I'll post more info as I get around to finding it.

Funny you should ask.  I've been taking apart the "Inbox" 
a=
pp, mainly because I want to understand how to use the 
scrolling text widg=
et, and I just figured out the message 
header a couple of days ago.

The first 4 bytes are =
a "file header", or maybe more 
correct, a "record header".  Either way, th=
ese first
4 bytes are part of the file system, not really part
of the messa=
ge.  The first byte is always FD, as you 
found. (I have seen FC, but I am =
not sure what it means.  
It may mean a deleted record.)

The second byte i=
s a "file number" that tells what file 
the record belongs to.  Third and f=
ourth bytes (word) 
are the file size, not counting the header iirc.  
The =
rest is a variable amount of file data.

I get the distinct impression that=
 each of these records
holds one complete message.

File/record format:

  =
  byte 0xFD
    byte filenumber
    word filesize
    data (message, addres=
sbook, or calendar data)

I don't thi=
nk there is a footer.  Perhaps what you
see is the "directory" record???  F=
or a file with
only one data record, the directory record will be
8 bytes (=
I think).

There does not seem to be any sort of text filenames
used (I gue=
ss embedded systems don't really need them).

Each file has it's own direct=
ory record.  These 
directory records are similar to the message
records, w=
ith the same 4 byte header format, except 
the file number is 0x40 + the fi=
le number of the
associated data records.

The data portion of a directory =
record is just a list 
of 4 byte addresses of the data records in that 
par=
ticular file.  

There is a special sector (in dataflash page 8)
That keeps=
 a list of the current addresses of
the directory records.  This special se=
ctor is
the only part of dataflash that they keep a 
use-count for.  I supp=
ose this is because that
sector is re-written whenever any file is
written,=
 and will get more use than any other
sector.  When use-count reaches 10,00=
0 it moves
this special sector up to next sector.  There
are 5 of these spe=
cial sectors reserved, and
after 50,000 writes, it starts re-using the 
sam=
e 5 sectors.

To top it all off, the 5th byte in the second-to-last
sector =
determines which of the 5 sectors is
currently in use!

But if you use the =
mailstation's read function, 
(0x089F), you don't need to worry about all 
=
these details.  ;^)

You just need the following details...

Message data f=
ormat:

    word offset_to_body
    byte flagbits
    word year
    byte mo=
nth
    byte day
    byte hour
    byte min
    byte sec
    subjectstring =
(padded to 142 dec bytes)
    fromstring ("tostring" in outbox)
    body of=
 message

The "tostring" in outbox messages can be more 
than one email add=
ress.

flagbits xxxx xxx1 =3D new message	

The "new" bit, when in outbox, =
seems to mean 
"ready to send".  Draft messages seem to be 
stored in outbo=
x with this bit cleared.

Several other bits have meaning, I'm not sure jus=
t
what.  Seems some might flag message as a "form"
rather than normal messa=
ge.  I have never seen one
of these forms, but I think they are a way for
c=
idco to send a fill-out-form, with checkboxes
and fill-in fields, to their =
customers.  I think
they get emailed back after being filled out.

The file=
 numbers I have figured out so far:

 00 - ??? 
 01 - ??? 
 02 - address bo=
ok
 03 - calendar
 04 - ???
 05 - inbox user 0 
 06 - inbox user 1
 07 - in=
box user 2
 08 - inbox user 3
 09 - inbox user 4 
 0A - outbox user 0
 0B -=
 outbox user 1
 0C - outbox user 2
 0D - outbox user 3
 0E - outbox user 4
=
 0F - sent user 0
 10 - sent user 1
 11 - sent user 2
 12 - sent user 3
 13=
 - sent user 4
 14 - ???? user 0   Not sure if files 14 thru 18 are used fo=
r anything.
 15 - ???? user 1   Seems that deleting user may erase/move the=
se,
 16 - ???? user 2   which implys they might be used for something.  
 1=
7 - ???? user 3
 18 - ???? user 4
 19 - ?             I think 19 thru 1E ar=

 1A - ?
 1B - ?
 1C - ?
 1D - ?
 1E - ?             highest fil=

Wow ..., I am very impressed that even MailStation still survives 
these da=
ys. I have mine, i.e. MailStation250 and MailStation350, 
completely forgot=
ten and stowed away on some shelves in the 
basement. ;) If anyone needs th=
ese, I will be more than happy to 
trade-in with something you have that I =
may find useful. Let me 
know.

I bought my mother (now 90) a Mailstation a few years ago when I moved to a timezone
far from hers. Now I'm back, but she likes e-maiing and wants to be able to print.

What's good (cheap, easy-to-connect) printer to use with the Mailstation?

Thanks,
Brian

Just avoid any Windows printers - most parallel port printers should
be fin=
e. Try your local Freecycle or Craig's List for one!

; Rather than d=
isturb the simplicity of the above code, 
; I will put the comments down he=
re.
;
; ".module crt0" simply defines a name for the linker to use 
; if it=
 needs to report where an undefined symbol was used.
;
; ".globl somesymbol=
" tells the assembler that somesymbol 
; will not be resolved until link ti=
me.
;
; ".area SOMEAREA" lets the linker group similar types of 
; code or =
data from the various modules, into single 
; contiguous areas in memory.  =

;
; This first code area will be the entrypoint to our code.  
; It is man=
datory that crt0.o be the first module linked
; for this reason.  
;
; Here=
 we just make a jump to "eventhandler", and
; leave a couple of pointers to=
 resource data.  The 
; mailstation firmware expects these to be at the hea=
d of 
; any app.  I added a jump to an install routine, just so 
; it too c=
an have a fixed address.
;
; We mention all the areas that our program will=
 use to
; force the linker to place them in a particular order.  
; The _CO=
DE & _DATA segments will be pegged to particular 
; addresses by the link c=
ommand. _HOME, _GSINIT, & _GSFINAL 
; will be in ROM, after the code segmen=
t.  _BSS & _HEAP 
; will be in RAM, after the data segment
;
; The compiler=
 will place any code for initializing globals 
; into the _GSINIT section. =
 Here, we place a label as the 
; first thing in _GSINIT, and a "ret" as th=
e last thing, 
; allowing the globals defined in all modules to be run 
; w=
ith a single call to _gsinit.
;
; Just what is crt0?
;
; crt0.o is a module=
 that is automatically linked by SDCC 
; when you link your code.  I imagin=
e historically it 
; contained code to run a crt terminal.  Now SDCC uses i=
t 
; to link any sort of startup code you may need for your 
; program.  Ty=
pically this would be:
;
;  1) init stack pointer.  
;  2) set up interrupt=
s.
;  3) init the globals.  
;  4) call your "main" function.  
;  5) imple=
ment any exit code needed.
;
; We don't do any of that!  :-)
;
; Since we a=
re going to run under the mailstations 
; existing OS, we can skip 1 & 2, '=
coz they are done 
; for us by ms firmware.  
;
; We skip number 3 because =
our code is just an event 
; handler, and we do not want our globals re-ini=
t'ed on 
; every event.  We will let our code call gsinit itself, 
; when i=
t receives a "sig_init" from the mailstation's OS.
;
; As for 4 & 5, we don=
't need any exit code, we just 
; return to the ms OS after each event we p=
rocess.  
; Since we don't need to come back here, rather than 
; call the =
"main" func, we just jump to it.  This has 
; the added advantage of leavin=
g the stack-frame as is, 
; so we can access the passed event directly.
;
;=
 Voil=E0!

Here is another, a modal dialog bo=
x, with a text message
field, and various combinations of buttons.  I have
=
tentatively called it "messagebox", but I am interested
in hearing any othe=
r suggestions for the name.  Also
any suggestions for the param names, and =
constant
names would be helpful!

int  messagebox(uint16_t res_str, uint16_=
t flags);

res_str:
   a resource string number

flags:
   0x0100 =3D ok

 =
  0x0200 =3D ok & cancel         (ok default)
   0x2200 =3D ok & cancel    =
     (cancel default)

   0x0400 =3D yes & no            (yes default)
   0=
x2400 =3D yes & no            (no default)

   0x0800 =3D yes & no & cancel=
   (yes default)
   0x2800 =3D yes & no & cancel   (no default)
   0x4800 =
=3D yes & no & cancel   (cancel default)

retval:
   1 =3D ok
   2 =3D canc=
el
   3 =3D yes
   4 =3D no


put this in mailstation.s:
_messagebox =3D=3D=
 0x07f1

----------------------------------------

Also, there is another f=
unction, at 0x0AD0, that
is the same as above except that it takes a normal=

string instead of a resource string.  What would
that one be called???  An=
ybody out there????????

Hi Don,

I am using programmers notepad, which I got as part of
winavr=
.  All I had to do to get it to work with SDCC was 
to create a new makefil=
e, with commands to compile with 
SDCC.

I discovered how easy it was to us=
e with SDCC by
accident, when I was looking at some sdcc code in 
wordpad. =
 I think my brain has gotten used to seeing 
C code with color syntax highl=
ighting, and it was kind 
of grating to look at everything in the same colo=
r.

So I thought I would open the file in winavr's 
"programmers notepad", =
just to edit it, and then
compile it with the bat file I had been using wit=
h
wordpad.  Well, it didn't take too long for me to
wonder if I could get a=
 makefile to run the bat
file.  Before I tried that, it clicked in my head
=
that I did not need the bat, I could just use
the makefile!

You don't need=
 winavr to get programmers notepad, but 
I think you might need at least th=
e gnu binutils
to use "make" (installs as part of winavr suite).

There is =
one quirk to programmers notepad (and it
may have something to do with the =
fact I am using it
under win98), but the "output window" has a habit
of dis=
appearing, and sometimes dialogs (like "open")
appear underneath the other =
windows.  It's only
mildly annoying after you understand what is happening.=


Some features I really like are the "tabbed" multiple 
editor windows, wh=
ere you can keep several files open, 
and the ability to select columns of =
text for 
cutting/pasting.  Also, it makes error messages (even
from SDCC) =
into clickable links, and puts cursor
on the error line when you click one.=
  And the color
syntax hightlighting, of course!

CJ

You have to remember that the Earthlink call center is in INDIA, and so are
the first level
techs and call takers.  Most of these do not have the expertise to call your
relative
and walk them through what is needed to set this up.

Best thing to do is get the unit back at your location, find a local or 800
number that
the unit can call from Toronto, and then call Earthlink yourself and walk
them through
it to get it set up.  After YOU have it working to your satisfaction, then
send it back to
Florida !!! (Make sure the old unit is NOT hooked up and working during this
time, or it
will mess things up)

This may be a little more work and hassle, but in the long run you will get
it running to
your satisfaction.

You will use the same email address, DSN address from both Toronto and
Florida.
Just might temporarily have to use a different dial up number to set it up
and then
change that number for something that would work from Florida.
All you really need them to do is authorize it for a new unit serial number.
They will
send a message to the old unit to turn off and a message to the new unit to
switch
the serial number address to your email address.

Good luck !!

Wayne

Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone can help me.  I got a Mailstation recently=
 for my 
mentally-handicapped brother, but Earthlink won't set up a new mai=
lbox 
for it.  I learned how to get in to change the email provider's addre=
ss 
from Earthlink, so I got a Bluebottle account, but the Mailstation 
can=
't receive it.  I'm guessing it's something to do with the anti-spam 
proto=
cols, but I'm not a programmer and I don't know what to do next.  
Can anyo=
ne help me?  If nothing else, suggest an email provider that 
Mailstation c=
ould receive?
Thanks in advance,
KJ

You need a local dial up number with a r=

won't do webmail. Where are you?

It is possible you won't be able to send any mail (if they
are using the "smtp auth" protocol (??? I think that is what 
it is called). But you should be able to pop your incoming mail.
-That's what I thought, but the Mailstation couldn't access the bluebottle site.  Maybe it tries to send first?

I checked www.bluebottle. com, but I could not tell if they
require the "auth" protocol. A lot of isp's do require it
these days.
-I know.

I don't know if the mailstation will work with bluebottle,
but according to the site the FREE account allows pop3
access. One thing that is kinda scary is the "Latest News"
on their homepage is dated August 2007!!! Are they still 
in business??? :-)
-They are; I sent them a question yesterday and got an answer the same day.  (It wasn't helpful, but it was an answer. . . )  I was looking specifically for POP email accounts, so I know it does allow access.

Also, I noticed that the smtp server is listed as down, 
since Sunday. Maybe that's your only problem???
(The service status is at bottom of the help page.)
-Thanks for letting me know; but I was testing the Mailstation on Friday, so that shouldn't have been the issue.

Both the pop3 and smtp servers are named mail.bluebottle. com ,
did you set them? Did you set a valid DNS server address?
-I definitely set the servers, and I set them correctly because I tested the same settings on my computer using Outlook Express.  I don't think I  set the DNS because I don't know where to find that address.

If you post the settings you are using, someone might 
have better suggestions to try.
-Thanks, I'll do that.  I don't have them with me right now but I'll post them tonight.

If he is using Telus he gets a free POP mail a=

You could use Gm=

An update:
Finally managed to fly my mum up here for a visit. Had her bring=
 both MailStations with 
her. Found it's telco dial out number was wrong. F=
ound the old 800 number in my original 
setup records (800-520-3236) was st=
ill active. Earthlink web tool said account "inactive". 
3 hours on the pho=
ne with about a dozen attempts got account turned back on despite 
those in=
competent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation. That was all th=
at was 
wrong with her original unit.
Seem to remember that Earthlink Serve=
r could reprogram the dial out number to a local 
access point based upon C=
all Display technology. It skips the Area Code part, though 
which is being=
 required in more and more areas.
When my mum goes back South, I expect the=
 server will change the 800 number to a local 
7 digit number. Then, when s=
he goes back north to Maine in a month or two, that dial up 
number will be=
 met with "The number you have dialed...." to which the Mailstation cannot =

respond.
At each new location she plugs her machine into, she needs to put=
 the 800 number back 
in to get 'On Line' again.
Anyone have an actual addr=
ess, telephone number and a bigwig's name of Earthlink's HQ 
wherever it is=
? I need compensation for these many months of no service, grief and 
frust=
ration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling agents.

I've tried to re-program my 'spare' Mailstation to one of my current Servic=
e Providers and 
can't get it to successfully talk to their server:

User N=
ame: Patrick Forbes
Dial Up Number: 905-571-1638
E-mail address: patrick.fo=
rbes@...
E-mail Password: xxxxxxx
POP3 Server: pophm.sympatico.ca
=
SMTP Server: smtphm.sympatico.ca
ISP Account: xxxxxxxx
ISP Password: xxxxxx=
xx 
Primary DNS: ###.###.###.###

Is there something strange in the MailSta=
tion protocol that is over my head? And over my 
Service Provider's as well=
?
I'm not a code guru but know some who are. Is there something I can do to=
 my 
MailStation? Is there something my Service Provider can do to their th=
ings that'll make it 
work?
What's "a Yahoo model"?

pophm and smtphm? Yeah, that's a giant red flag. I found this message:

"I was unwillingly and uninformedly 'migrated' by Sympatico to the pophm and 
smtphm servers this past week. Got the pophm.sympatico.ca settings working 
with their information, but the smtphm.sympatico.ca settings required some 
frustration, learning and experimentation. For me, it turned out that 
setting the outbound (smtp) server protocol to TLS and using port 587 did 
the trick. If that helps you, great. If not ... well, good luck".

I don't think a mailstation can work with these new type servers - I'd try 
to find a small local place that uses a Unix/Linux server with a simple 
login protocol. Tell them you want email only for 5 minutes a day max. and 
you can't do any funny login protocols.

Avoid any big ones ("Free trial only") as they won't work.

BTW, not the same subject but see http://www.magicjack.com/ for another way 
to keep in touch. Even cheaper than email, but you'd need to have it on your 
system since I assume you don't want your mom on a broadband system.

I saw that, too and I was intrigued. I do remember the moment, a few  
years ago, when that change occurred. I was quite upset at the time  
with their lack of notice and poor walk-through process to fix up my  
Mac's config.
"Outbound ..." and "Port...."? I don't know how to deal with that  
with a MailStation. Must be buried in the 'S' records somewhere......
Will be contacting Sympatico with this info and insist (or try  
to....) they provide config that accommodates my MailStation.....

Wonderful information. Must thank you. You a guru?

login protocol. Tell them you want email only for 5 minutes a day  
max. and
you can't do any funny login protocols.

Avoid any big ones ("Free trial only") as they won't work.

BTW, not the same subject but see http://www.magicjack.com/ for  
another way
to keep in touch. Even cheaper than email, but you'd need to have it  
on your
system since I assume you don't want your mom on a broadband system.

Mainly for Unix. BTW, there used to be some community ISPs around which 
would give you free net access for a small annual fee. Don't know if that 
applies in your case.

I saw that, too and I was intrigued. I do remember the moment, a few years 
ago, when that change occurred. I was quite upset at the time with their 
lack of notice and poor walk-through process to fix up my Mac's config.
"Outbound ..." and "Port...."? I don't know how to deal with that with a 
MailStation. Must be buried in the 'S' records somewhere......
Will be contacting Sympatico with this info and insist (or try to....) they 
provide config that accommodates my MailStation.....

Wonderful information. Must thank you. You a guru?

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs. 
I thi=
nk they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
mom, also 90=
, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
work computer models=
 four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
there the other day trying =
to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
3 hours on the phone with..."th=
ose fools in India" (nicely put!) and
all to no avail.  When pressed for in=
formation on repair or
replacement, they got rude.

So, I tried the online =
chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
persistent rumor that there a=
re no NEW MailStation accounts being
established, they just kept referring =
me to the 800 number (aka "fools
in India") and ASSURING me these folks wou=
ld help.  I kept insisting
we'd already tried that, and the argument became=
 circular and a
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replace=
ment"
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
u=
nit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
not bein=
g transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
guessed it... the f=
ools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
"Thanks for nothing."

Mom's=
 only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to =
access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset.  We=
 suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
to just live with send=
ing individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I thi=
nk you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still wo=
rking at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

I g=
uess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
(which is=
 now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
your id=
eas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
the machine=
 is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).

When I was visiting in Decem=
ber, I took the machine over to a friend's
house because she had an old par=
allel-port printer.  I wanted to print
out Mom's address book for two reaso=
ns: 1) a planned e-mail
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her =
90th birthday card
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got=
 wiped, as it
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up t=
he
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
be =
far too easy...)
  
Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to gr=
oups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine an=
d it has
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her=

to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from i=
ndividual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be gla=
d the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another ye=
ar on the service.

Well, in the course of printing out the address book, t=
his idiot
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the pri=
nter
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
ha=
ve glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
to Mom=
's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
machine.  We sus=
pect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
your jump drive out =
of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
leaving that day and didn't =
have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
had two people look at it since =
- a young computer geek and an
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it=
 for her.  The young guy
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory=
" diagnosis.  The
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, =
trying to fix
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working =
at all
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

Anybody have any ideas =
what's wrong or how to fix it without the
Indians being involved?

Thanks.

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement. 
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I 
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my 
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended 
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person. 
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product  
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support  
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on  
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for  
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their  
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I  
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.

Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data  
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.  
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no  
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where  
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:

User Name:
Dial Up Number:
E-mail address:
E-mail Password:
POP3 Server:
SMTP Server:
ISP Account:
ISP Password:
Primary DNS:

I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six  
years later I needed them!

Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole  
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.

Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't  
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.  
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....  
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status

If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please  
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.

Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all  
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info  
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.

More later.....

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
replacement, they got rude.

So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
"Thanks for nothing."

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

2. Any Ideas about this problem?
     Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77
     Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).

When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
be far too easy...)

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
Indians being involved?

Thanks.

The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,
but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the
only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print
in color.

Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more
security for locking you from getting in to work on it.

It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself
and move to a working account. The "special" email has
MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the
internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.

Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these
characters to be received by the machine.

The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the
serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special
encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.

You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink
will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,
and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special characters,
which you won't see or be able to print out.

You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using these
mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???

If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until
Earthlink
finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to
there !!!

As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!

  Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product Life)
spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support anything more
than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on our own here. I just
learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for bankruptcy this past January.
My calls and faxes to them for their engineering assistance went unanswered
and I expect the letter I posted to them a week ago will be coming back
soon, too.



  Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data are
pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information. Start with
'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no typos. You will
most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where you'll need to type it
all in just as you saw it:


  User Name:
  Dial Up Number:
  E-mail address:
  E-mail Password:
  POP3 Server:
  SMTP Server:
  ISP Account:
  ISP Password:
  Primary DNS:

  I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six
years later I needed them!


  Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole in
the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.


  Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't operational.
Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test. When it's done press
the Reset again to get back to the Diag.... screen. Press Q to return the
machine to operational status


  If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.


  Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all said
they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info from them
to set up a trial with each on my machine.


  More later.....


  Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

  Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
  I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
  mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
  work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
  there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
  3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
  all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
  replacement, they got rude.


  So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
  persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
  established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
  in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
  we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
  standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
  (which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
  unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
  not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
  guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
  "Thanks for nothing."


  Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
  attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
  to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
  to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
  from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
  and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
  for another year on the service.


  I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
  (which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

    3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned

  That was all that was

    Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name
  of Earthlink's HQ
    wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no
  service, grief and
    frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling
  agents.

  Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
  I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
  couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
  name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
  hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.
  Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call

  2. Any Ideas about this problem?

  I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
  your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
  the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).


  When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
  house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
  out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
  announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
  shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
  did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
  address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
  be far too easy...)


  Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
  attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
  to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
  to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
  from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
  and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
  for another year on the service.


  Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
  friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
  during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
  have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
  to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
  machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
  your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
  leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
  had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
  old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
  had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
  old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
  the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
  and they cannot set up any new mail groups.


  Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
  Indians being involved?


  Thanks.

  <DIV>your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and li=

  <DIV>the machine is in OH, but I may visit=

  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>When I was visiting in D=

  <DIV>house becaus=
e she had an old parallel-port printer.<SPAN 
  class=3DApple-converted-spa=

Mom's friends for her 90th birthday 
  card</DIV>
  <DIV>shower, and 2) pap=

  it</DIV>
  <DIV>did onc=
e before.<SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space>&nbsp; </SPAN>(You'd 
  THINK =
they'd have a way to back up the</DIV>
  <DIV>address book to the associate=

that'd</DIV>
  <DIV>be far too easy...)</=
DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer =
send to groups, and 
any</DIV>
  <DIV>attempt to access her former groups f=
reezes up the machine and it 
  has</DIV>

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'  
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name  
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose  
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which  
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.
Take a look.

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry  
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll  
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.  
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!

So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the

groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may  
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me  
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access

Don't worry - I won't publish this anywhere, just print it out for my

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product  
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support  
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on  
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for  
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their  
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I  
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.

Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data  
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.  
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no  
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where  
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:

User Name:
Dial Up Number:
E-mail address:
E-mail Password:
POP3 Server:
SMTP Server:
ISP Account:
ISP Password:
Primary DNS:

I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six  
years later I needed them!

Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole  
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.

Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't  
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.  
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....  
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status

If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please  
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.

Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all  
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info  
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.

More later.....

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
replacement, they got rude.

So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
"Thanks for nothing."

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call
centers sucks!!!

2. Any Ideas about this problem?
     Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77
     Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).

When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
be far too easy...)

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
Indians being involved?

Thanks.

Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian  
vernacular. If a 'Group' worked, the others should if the others  
still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.  
Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.

Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and  
I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And  
I am.......
Hey, I'm our organization's Guru and this is testing ME. And I beat

it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to  
all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).   
As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"  
anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old  
non-geek, to tell exactly what's going on.

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'  
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name  
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose  
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which  
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.
Take a look.

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry  
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll  
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.  
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!

So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the  
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not  
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may  
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me  
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access  
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope  
you got your mom all fixed up too.

Don't worry - I won't publish this anywhere, just print it out for my

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product  
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support  
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on  
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for  
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their  
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I  
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.

Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data  
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.  
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no  
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where  
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:

User Name:
Dial Up Number:
E-mail address:
E-mail Password:
POP3 Server:
SMTP Server:
ISP Account:
ISP Password:
Primary DNS:

I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six  
years later I needed them!

Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole  
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.

Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't  
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.  
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....  
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status

If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please  
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.

Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all  
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info  
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.

More later.....

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
replacement, they got rude.

So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
"Thanks for nothing."

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call

2. Any Ideas about this problem?
     Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77
     Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).

When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
be far too easy...)

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
Indians being involved?

Thanks.

I DID IT!!!!!

Of the three ISP outfits that actually replied to me, only one  
finally came through. Offered a 30 day Money back guarantee, to boot!
I wiped the ROM then,
Press Power, Fn + Shift + T + Reset pin, then '3: F/A Tester' then  
'6: Flash test'. When done, press Back then Q. It then asks for Reset  
queries which you ignore as all was wiped any way. You'll then get:
"Please create a new user account." press Enter.
Then you fill in each field carefully:

User Name: Your name
Dial Up Number: supplied by the ISP dashes are for convention and are  
ignored by systems

The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,
but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the
only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print
in color.

Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more
security for locking you from getting in to work on it.

It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself
and move to a working account. The "special" email has
MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the
internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.

Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these
characters to be received by the machine.

The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the
serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special
encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.

You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink
will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,
and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special  
characters,
which you won't see or be able to print out.

You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using  
these
mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???

If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until
Earthlink
finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to
there !!!

As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!

   Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention  
(Product Life)
spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support anything more
than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on our own here.  
I just
learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for bankruptcy this past  
January.
My calls and faxes to them for their engineering assistance went

   Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed

pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information. Start with

years later I needed them!


   Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset  
hole in
the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.


   Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't  
operational.
Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test. When it's done  
press
the Reset again to get back to the Diag.... screen. Press Q to return

   If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.

   Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
   I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
   mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
   work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
   there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent  
about
   3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
   all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
   replacement, they got rude.


   So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
   persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
   established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka  
"fools
   in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
   we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
   standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
   (which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
   unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
   not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
   guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
   "Thanks for nothing."


   Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
   attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
   to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
   to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
   from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a  
time)
   and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re- 
upped
   for another year on the service.


   I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
   (which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

   Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board  
replacement.
   I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
   couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my

       Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77
       Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))


   I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
   your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK  
and
   the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).


   When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a  
friend's
   house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to  
print
   out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
   announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
   shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
   did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
   address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
   be far too easy...)


   Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
   attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
   to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
   to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
   from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a  
time)
   and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re- 
upped
   for another year on the service.


   Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
   friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
   during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
   have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it  
back
   to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
   machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you  
pull
   your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
   leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she  
has
   had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
   old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
   had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
   old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to  
fix
   the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
   and they cannot set up any new mail groups.


   Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
   Indians being involved?


   Thanks.

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.
Take a look.

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and
locally including the "pinhole" reset) and the groups still refuse to
function, which is what leads us to believe in the "bad flash memory

that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!

So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope
you got your mom all fixed up too.

Don't worry - I won't publish this anywhere, just print it out for my
own use.

out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
be far too easy...)

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
Indians being involved?

Thanks.

Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian
vernacular. If a 'Group' worked, the others should if the others
still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.
Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.

Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and
I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And
I am.......

I'm 900 miles from the machine.  However, I recall she had three

the third locked up the machine, requiring the "pinhole" reset.  I
suggested she just abandon the "bad" group, rename it something
similar, and start the bad group over.  Apparently, it wouldn't let
them set up any new groups, and after the tech friend and the Indians
finished messing with it, NONE of the groups would work anymore and
it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to
all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).
As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"
anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old
non-geek, to tell exactly what's going on.

When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'
a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name
it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose
from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which
you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.
Take a look.

They've tried resetting EVERYTHING (both remotely by the Indians and
locally including the "pinhole" reset) and the groups still refuse to
function, which is what leads us to believe in the "bad flash memory

that's probably something only the Indians can do (if they even can).

Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry
to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll
enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.
Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.

Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!

So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......

Wow, Patrick.  Thanks for the tech info.  As it stands right now, the
machine and service are WORKING for individual e-mails, just not
groups, so she's content for now.  If I visit Ohio this summer, I may
try this stuff.  I have an old WebTV box and may take that with me
and set her up with that.  She would have e-mail AND full web access
for the same annual service fee as the Earthlink e-mail thing.  Hope
you got your mom all fixed up too.

Don't worry - I won't publish this anywhere, just print it out for my
own use.

Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product
Life) spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support
anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on
our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for
bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their
engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I
posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.

Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data
are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.
Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no
typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where
you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:

User Name:
Dial Up Number:
E-mail address:
E-mail Password:
POP3 Server:
SMTP Server:
ISP Account:
ISP Password:
Primary DNS:

I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six
years later I needed them!

Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.

Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status

If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please
don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.

Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all
said they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info
from them to set up a trial with each on my machine.

More later.....

Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
replacement, they got rude.

So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
(which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
"Thanks for nothing."

Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
for another year on the service.

I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
(which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.
Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call

I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like

My most sincere apologies. I forgot to trim my previous note and add:
This applies to the Mivo 100 flavour of the Cidco DETI MailStation,  
but I'm sure there is a wiping trick of some sort somewhere for the  
350 that may accomplish the same thing. Maybe a variation on mine?
If you can get to the Diag screen and do a flash test, that should  
get your Advanced settings open for input. To save yourself the time  
I took, remember to write down the sequences that didn't work!

Attention Gurus out there.

Is there a 'Settings, Advanced' page you can get to on the 350? Does  
it resemble what's below?

I DID IT!!!!! E-mails From, To and Replies back and forth to my Mac  
and my Cell were ALL quite successful.

I now feel confident enough to move my mother from Earthlink to  
BasicISP as Mid Maine is State wide only and Verizon seems to have  
their call centre in India, too which explains their lack of  
cooperation with my little request.

Of the three ISP outfits that actually replied to me, only one  
finally came through. Offered a 30 day Money back guarantee, to boot!
I wiped the ROM by:
Press Power, Fn + Shift + T + Reset pin, then '3: F/A Tester' then  
'6: Flash test'. When done, press Back then Q. It then asks for Reset  
queries which you ignore as all was wiped anyway. You'll then get:
"Please create a new user account." press Enter.
Then you fill in each field VERY carefully as a single typo will mean  
you start over. The password won't be displayed:

User Name: Your name
Dial Up Number: supplied by the ISP. Dashes are only for convention  
and are ignored by the modem.
Reply -To: skip this if you'd like
E-mail address: you@...
E-mail Password: your password shown as **********
POP3 Server: mail.basicisp.net
SMTP Server: mail.basicisp.net
ISP Account: you@...
ISP Password: your password shown as **********
Primary DNS: 65.247.64.21 From them. You gotta ask for this. It's not  
in that file they send.

The information is supplied by BasicISP in a really strange file that  
only Notepad could open. You glean your required info from it.

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

  The problem is that you can do that with the smaller mailstations,
  but you can't do most of this with the model 350, which is the
  only one that will allow you to get email graphics, and print
  in color.


  Although the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more
  security for locking you from getting in to work on it.


  It requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself
  and move to a working account. The "special" email has
  MIME control characters in it, which can not be sent over the
  internet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.


  Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these
  characters to be received by the machine.


  The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the
  serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the special
  encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.


  You can not send a message to these "Special" accounts, Earthlink
  will not pass the message.  But you CAN log into these accounts,
  and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special
characters,
  which you won't see or be able to print out.


  You would think that Earthlink would be happy to add customers using these
  mailstations, but that does not seem to be the case ???


  If you think the Indian call center is bad, wait a few more years until
  Earthlink
  finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it from India to
  there !!!


  As the big shots are making their millions at the top !!!

    Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product
Life)
  spans are too short. No company wants to seriously support anything more
  than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on our own here. I
just
  learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for bankruptcy this past January.
  My calls and faxes to them for their engineering assistance went
unanswered
  and I expect the letter I posted to them a week ago will be coming back
  soon, too.






    Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data
are
  pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information. Start with
  'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no typos. You will
  most certainly be asked to "Create New User" where you'll need to type it
  all in just as you saw it:




    User Name:
    Dial Up Number:
    E-mail address:
    E-mail Password:
    POP3 Server:
    SMTP Server:
    ISP Account:
    ISP Password:
    Primary DNS:


    I photocopied all the screens and filed the copies for posterity. Six
  years later I needed them!




    Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole in
  the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.




    Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't operational.
  Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test. When it's done press
  the Reset again to get back to the Diag.... screen. Press Q to return the
  machine to operational status




    If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please
  don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.




    Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all said
  they 'may' be able to provide service. I'm waiting for more info from them
  to set up a trial with each on my machine.




    More later.....

    Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
    I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
    mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
    work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
    there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
    3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
    all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
    replacement, they got rude.




    So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
    persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
    established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
    in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
    we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
    standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
    (which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
    unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
    not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
    guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
    "Thanks for nothing."




    Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
    attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
    to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
    to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
    from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
    and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
    for another year on the service.




    I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
    (which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

      An update:




      3 hours on the phone with about a dozen attempts got account turned
    back on despite
      those incompetent fools in India and MailStation resumed operation.
    That was all that was
      wrong with her original unit.




      Anyone have an actual address, telephone number and a bigwig's name
    of Earthlink's HQ
      wherever it is? I need compensation for these many months of no
    service, grief and
      frustration at the hands of those imbeciles they insist on calling
    agents.

    Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
    I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
    couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
    name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
    hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.
    Man how can't you not understand the name "marcus". Off shore call

    2. Any Ideas about this problem?
        Posted by: "musicalman77" musicalman77@... musicalman77
        Date: Sat Apr 19, 2008 3:09 pm ((PDT))




    I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
    your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
    the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).




    When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
    house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
    out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
    announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
    shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
    did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
    address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
    be far too easy...)




    Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
    attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
    to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
    to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
    from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
    and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
    for another year on the service.




    Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
    friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
    during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
    have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
    to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
    machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
    your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
    leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
    had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
    old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
    had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
    old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
    the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
    and they cannot set up any new mail groups.




    Anybody have any ideas what's wrong or how to fix it without the
    Indians being involved?




    Thanks.

  When I boot my MailStation and select 'Address Book' and press 'New,'
  a choice of Individual or Groups appears. Select 'Groups' and name
  it. It will then show the whole 'Groups' list to pick and choose
  from. Press 'Add' and the Address Book list will appear from which
  you may pick the Groups 'Members' you wish to add to that group.
  Take a look.

  Her 'Groups' will most certainly need to be re-programmed, I'm sorry
  to say. Please remember the KISS Principle. I'm pretty sure she'll
  enjoy a fully functional MailStation a bit more than the Web on TV.
  Might be too many buttons to remember to push in the right order.


  Yup. Mom is back on line. Just a stupid typo. Dumb indians!


  So far, BasicISP is working with me to test their servers.......

  Don't waste any more of your time with Earthlink. Attention (Product

  anything more than five (5) years old, nowadays. We're pretty much on
  our own here. I just learned Cidco, who made the thing, filed for
  bankruptcy this past January. My calls and faxes to them for their
  engineering assistance went unanswered and I expect the letter I
  posted to them a week ago will be coming back soon, too.


  Regardless of your choices, chances you will lose all programmed data
  are pretty great. Please write down ALL programming information.
  Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and ensure you've no

  you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it:

  Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole
  in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.


  Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't
  operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.
  When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....

  If anyone else has additional tricks to share along this line, please
  don't be shy. I have a working machine I can experiment with at will.


  Verizon ($8.95/m), Look ($4.95/m), BasicISP and Mid-Maine have all

  Good luck with getting any kind of help out of Earthlink's big-wigs.
  I think they are trying hard to wash their hands of MailStation. My
  mom, also 90, had a problem with her machine.  A friend who use to
  work computer models four levels down from the (U.S.) President was
  there the other day trying to remedy the trouble.  He also spent about
  3 hours on the phone with..."those fools in India" (nicely put!) and
  all to no avail.  When pressed for information on repair or
  replacement, they got rude.


  So, I tried the online chat with Earthlink CS.  After confirming the
  persistent rumor that there are no NEW MailStation accounts being
  established, they just kept referring me to the 800 number (aka "fools
  in India") and ASSURING me these folks would help.  I kept insisting
  we'd already tried that, and the argument became circular and a
  standoff.  So, I asked, "Well, what about repair or replacement"
  (which they have done in the past) and was told, "She can buy a new
  unit on her own."  When I said that I understood that accounts were
  not being transferred to new machines, I was referred to... you
  guessed it... the fools in India.  I finally gave up and told her
  "Thanks for nothing."


  Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
  attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
  to be reset.  We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory.  I told her
  to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
  from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
  and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
  for another year on the service.


  I guess if the thing breaks, I'll hook her up with my old WebTV unit
  (which is now MSN TV) and hope she can learn to use it.

  Talk about dealing those people. I was doing a system board replacement.
  I called and was transfered to them. I was getting upset because I
  couldn't understand what they were saying. They could understand my
  name, asked me to spell it out several times. Getting it wrong. I ended
  hanging up on them and call back hoping on getting a different person.

  I posted in part about this in the reply to Patrick, but would like
  your ideas on any way to fix this problem (and like him, I'm in OK and
  the machine is in OH, but I may visit there mid-summer).


  When I was visiting in December, I took the machine over to a friend's
  house because she had an old parallel-port printer.  I wanted to print
  out Mom's address book for two reasons: 1) a planned e-mail
  announcement by my sister to Mom's friends for her 90th birthday card
  shower, and 2) paper backup in case her machine ever got wiped, as it
  did once before.  (You'd THINK they'd have a way to back up the
  address book to the associated EarthLink webmail account, but that'd
  be far too easy...)


  Mom's only trouble is that she can no longer send to groups, and any
  attempt to access her former groups freezes up the machine and it has
  to be reset. We suspect a bad spot in the flash memory. I told her
  to just live with sending individual e-mails or do her group people
  from individual e-mail (I think you can do three recipients at a time)
  and be glad the thing is still working at all, since she just re-upped
  for another year on the service.


  Well, in the course of printing out the address book, this idiot
  friend ignored my advice and tried to stuff more paper in the printer
  during the print job, jamming it.  I got it restarted, but this may
  have glitched something in the MailStation, because once I got it back
  to Mom's, one of her groups stopped working and would freeze the
  machine.  We suspect a problem in the flash memory, like when you pull
  your jump drive out of the USB port as it's being accessed.  I was
  leaving that day and didn't have time to mess with it.  So, so she has
  had two people look at it since - a young computer geek and an
  old-time computer guru, and trying to fix it for her.  The young guy
  had limited time but agreed with the "flash memory" diagnosis.  The
  old guy spent hours, alone, and on the phone with India, trying to fix
  the problem.  Now, apparently NONE of the groups are working at all
  and they cannot set up any new mail groups.

  Whoa! That sounds a wee bit fishy, if you don't mind the Canadian
  vernacular. If a 'Group' worked, the others should if the others
  still have 'valid' addresses with no defects (typos) in them.
  Possible? Remember, it's only a computer. It's not that smart, eh.


  Yeah, I understand. My Mom is back in Florida (but now on-line) and
  I'm in Toronto. But I have amy own MailStation to play with, now. And
  I am.......
  Hey, I'm our organization's Guru and this is testing ME. And I beat

  I'm 900 miles from the machine.  However, I recall she had three

  suggested she just abandon the "bad" group, rename it something
  similar, and start the bad group over.  Apparently, it wouldn't let
  them set up any new groups, and after the tech friend and the Indians
  finished messing with it, NONE of the groups would work anymore and
  it won't let them set up new groups, only individuals (which had to
  all be re-input manually - apparenlty the Indians wiped everything).
  As far as what they are telling me, groups just "don't work"
  anymore.  It's hard for me, from here and dealing with a 90-year-old
  non-geek, to tell exactly what's going on.

  <DIV>The problem is that you can do that with the smaller ma=
ilstations,</DIV>
  <DIV>but you can't do most of this with the model 350, =
which is the</DIV>
  <DIV>only one that will allow you to get email graphic=
s, and print</DIV>
  <DIV>in color.</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Although=
 the Model 350 has more memory, it also has more</DIV>
  <DIV>security for =
locking you from getting in to work on it.</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>I=
t requires that it get an email from Earthlink to program itself</DIV>
  <D=
IV>and move to a working account. The "special" email has</DIV>
  <DIV>MIME=
 control characters in it, which can not be sent over the</DIV>
  <DIV>inte=
rnet thru other ISP's since they are filtered out.</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
=
  <DIV>Only a direct connection to the ISP (Earthlink) will allow these</DI=
V>
  <DIV>characters to be received by the machine.</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>=

  <DIV>The machine goes to a special account on Earthlink, which is the</D=
IV>
  <DIV>serial number of the machine @earthlink . It receives the specia=
l</DIV>
  <DIV>encoded message, and then changes to "Your" account.</DIV>
 =
 <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>You can not send a message to these "Special" accou=
nts, Earthlink</DIV>
  <DIV>will not pass the message.<SPAN class=3DApple-c=
onverted-space>&nbsp; 
  </SPAN>But you CAN log into these accounts,</DIV>
=
  <DIV>and see what the mailstation is getting, except for the special 
  c=
haracters,</DIV>
  <DIV>which you won't see or be able to print out.</DIV>
=
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>You would think that Earthlink would be happy to a=
dd customers using 
  these</DIV>
  <DIV>mailstations, but that does not se=
em to be the case ???</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>If you think the India=
n call center is bad, wait a few more years 
  until</DIV>
  <DIV>Earthlink=
</DIV>
  <DIV>finds a cheaper place to hire labor, and then they move it fr=
om India 
  to</DIV>
  <DIV>there !!!</DIV>

I ended up doing just that. My mom came up for a visit and brought  
them both. Her's had a typo. Fixed it and it's back on line and now  
back in Florida E-mailing merrily along with the old 800# I found in  
a photocopy I made of the Settings prior to shipping it South 6 years  
ago. I assume Earthlink's server  will re-program the number to a  
Florida number, so I found the numbers for her other locations she  
travels to (for a woman of 78 she sure is on the move) and wrote out  
the reprograming procedure for her.

I now own my own MailStation and found BasicISP. Signed up after  
getting an E-mail promise, programmed it and: Voila, it works like a  
charm with them for $6.95/m. They have Web mail access to boot.  
Verizon and Mid Maine dropped the ball.

This July when I go out to Maine, I'll cancel her Earthlink, change  
my account over to my her and re-program her MailStation to BasicISP  
like mine now is. You know, I could walk her through it this week.

To you all:

Take a close look at BasicISP for your MailStation needs. These folks  
are wonderful and they're here in North America, to boot. Ain't it cool!

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

Best thing to do is get the unit back at your location, find a local  
or 800 number that
the unit can call from Toronto, and then call Earthlink yourself and  
walk them through
it to get it set up.  After YOU have it working to your satisfaction,  
then send it back to
Florida !!! (Make sure the old unit is NOT hooked up and working  
during this time, or it
will mess things up)

This may be a little more work and hassle, but in the long run you  
will get it running to
your satisfaction.

You will use the same email address, DSN address from both Toronto  
and Florida.
Just might temporarily have to use a different dial up number to set  
it up and then
change that number for something that would work from Florida.
All you really need them to do is authorize it for a new unit serial  
number.  They will
send a message to the old unit to turn off and a message to the new  
unit to switch
the serial number address to your email address.

Good luck !!

I'm hoping to get some assistance. I bought my mother a Mailstation 6  
some years ago and it
went dim this summer. I picked up a replacement on eBay and shipped  
it down (Florida). I
can't seem to get Earthlink to call her to 'Walk her' through the  
programming on the
replacement despite several attempts.

If this doesn't work would hacking it be a viable 'plan B' to put it  
onto another more reliable
and professional ISP. I've a few in mind at this point.

Someone here able to help me? I'm in Toronto and the unit is in Florida.

Patrick

Subject: yahoo groups owner email

Hi,
I am trying to get a hold of the mailstation group owner, I have a ms
that I'm starting to have some fun with. I can not seem to contact the
group owner, as membership has been pending for around a week! I'm
guessing he may not check the yahoo email very often........do you
have his alternate email address so I can contact him?

Mel

Check the SPAM and firewall settings on your email account setup.
That is going to decide what you allow in and what you bounce.
Might also check your SPAM box to see if they went there !!

One quick way to find out is to drop your Spam filter, and have her send you
a message.
Also, there should be a box in your email account setup for selecting Text
or Mime output.

Then ALL your emails will be sent as the same way.  You could also check
with Yahoo and see
if they did a software change about 10 days ago ??

Had a similar problem when our ISP changed us to new IP addresses. It seems
the new IP's
were listed as SPAM originating IP's by a Spam blocker, and Google and Yahoo
wouldn't
process them, just dropped them.  Once the blocking was taken off the IP
addresses, we
had no problem sending them.

Get the IP address off her machine and run it through a Spam check (search
for it on the web).

Wayne

IME Yahoo mail has always been buggy. GMail is far more robust and defaults=
 to plain text IIRC.

I've had long delays at times with Yahoo.

  Any ideas???????=

My little, very time consuming exercise in locating, identifying and  
testing the services of 'other' ISPs for our MailStations has shown  
only one that is head and shoulders above the rest. Earthlink being  
at the bottom.

If you follow my previously published instructions on how to wipe  
your machine, contact BasicISP.net and for $6.95/month they can put  
you back on line. With any luck you may get your old address with a  
new 'extension' on it. They have shown themselves as being an outfit  
well worthy of our business. Their Customer Service quality and setup  
info and assistance is outstanding. They leave the others in the dust.

All you need to ask for is:
A dial up telco number that won't cost you a fortune,
E-mail Address: (pretty well your choice)
E-mail Password: (pretty well your choice)
POP3 Server: Address
SMTP Server: Address
ISP Account ID on a 'POP3 Server' (very important)
ISP Account Password:

and most importantly, the Primary DNS Address.

That's all you need during MailStation Account Setup programming and  
you're on-line.
I've done it several times with a few prospective ISPs and only  
BasicISP came through with flying colours.

Check them out for yourself.

Please feel free to use me as a referral to them when you call. I'm  
'meema@...' on their books. I'm holding the address for my  
mother for next month when I'm switching her over.

Or contact me if difficulties arise, please.

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

Patrick

I didn't change any settings on my Yahoo account(s) at all, and I
check my Spam folder daily.  This just happened about 10 days ago.
One day I was getting e-mails from Mom as I have for years, then the
next day, I couldn't.  She's not getting "bounce" messages on them;
they are just vanishing.  I had her verify that she was sending them
to my correct address, and as stated in my original post, even had her
"reply" to them from two different Yahoo accounts.  NOTHING!  I'm
convinced it has something to do with her MailStation hardware, but I
don't know what it could be.
o do with her machine, I think.

So has anyone had any luck in getting the 350 to work with a different
ISP?=


  I have read a few threads in this group about the 350, but the 100
and =
other mailstations seem to migrate into the 350 discussion, which
makes it =
very difficult to keep seperate.

  I thought that I had the instructions o=
n a couple of different
threads and after rereading them, i am no longer su=
re that they apply
to the 350!

Far as I know, nobody has had any luck on the 350 unit.  I have several of
them,
and have not been able to change anything on them.  I did mess with the
Eprom
on one of them, and now it will not do anything !!!  (Don't erase the
memory)

If anybody knows anything, please let us know !!!!

  So has anyone had any luck in getting the 350 to work with a different
  ISP?

  I have read a few threads in this group about the 350, but the 100
  and other mailstations seem to migrate into the 350 discussion, which
  makes it very difficult to keep seperate.

  I thought that I had the instructions on a couple of different
  threads and after rereading them, i am no longer sure that they apply
  to the 350!

I did, with a 100.
I'd suggest, after my successful experimentation with my 100, that  
you try anything that takes you to its ROM test, or something to that  
effect.
If you manage to get that done, the account data should be erased.  
When you power it back on, you should get something like "Create New  
Account"
Fill in the fields with the info I previously provided in this board  
that you get from BasicISP. That should work.
Contact me for additional assistance, if you need.

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

The setup for the model 100 is NOT the same as the Model 350.

What you can easily do on the 100 you can NOT do on the 350.

So far, I have not found or heard of anyone getting a Model 350 to
change and work on a new ISP or change the "Account Data"
in it.

If you do a ROM test on the Model 350, it wipes out ALL the
data on the unit, and it will NOT run anymore !!!!  Be warned !!!!

Absolutely! Of all the outfits I've found, ONLY BasicISP followed  
through with an operating system and a great deal. Their Customer  
Service is wonderful.
Yes, it really is $6.95/month. Please follow carefully the notes I  
put on the board. They're tested and work well.
Mine is currently unplugged as I will be transferring the account to  
my mum's Mailstation when I get out there.

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

I would like to get the mailstation online for our communication use.
Your post led me to their sight and am now wondering as to your

Thank you for your response (if on message board rather than email

I scoped it out and found:

To wipe the unit:
You will lose all programmed data. Please write down ALL programming  
information. Start with 'Extras', 'Settings' then 'Details' and  
ensure you've no typos. You will most certainly be asked to "Create  
New User" where you'll need to type it all in just as you saw it.

Press FN, Shift and T with one hand and stick a pin in the Reset hole  
in the back. The Diagnostic Menu will appear.

Press the 3 for the F/A Tester. The five grey keys aren't  
operational. Select the test of your choice. Start with Fast Test.  
When it's done press the Reset again to get back to the Diag....  
screen. Press Q to return the machine to operational status.

If you follow my previously published instructions on how to wipe  
your machine, contact BasicISP.net and for $6.95/month they can put  
you back on line. With any luck you may get your old address with a  
new 'extension' on it. They have shown themselves as being an outfit  
well worthy of our business. Their Customer Service quality and setup  
info and assistance is outstanding. They leave the others in the dust.

All you need to ask for is:
A dial up telco number that won't cost you a fortune from where you are,
E-mail Address: (pretty well your choice)
E-mail Password: (pretty well your choice, too)
POP3 Server: Address
SMTP Server: Address
ISP Account ID on a 'POP3 Server' (very important)
ISP Account Password: (pretty well your choice, but maybe not)

and most importantly, the Primary DNS Address.

That's all you need during MailStation Account Setup programming and  
you're on-line.
I've done it several times with a few prospective ISPs and only  
BasicISP came through with flying colours.

Check them out for yourself.

Please feel free to use me as a referral to them when you call. I'm  
'meema@...' on their books. I'm holding the address for my mother for  
next month when I'm switching her over.

Or contact me if difficulties arise, please.

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

I would think that is something that ISP net puts in ???
It goes through their mail server !!

Might be that ISP.net also owns ISP.com and they are
actually one in the same.

But you could fill in the the "Reply To" and see if there is a
difference ??

Never Mind....  I found the problem.  When you type in the email
address in=
 the mailstation you really need to watch what you type.  If
you type usern=
ame@....  that is what you will get.  I just
had to change it to u=
sername@... and the problem is solved.

Congrats! I'm thrilled to bits! They're a wonderful outfit that can  
service the Mail Station quite well. The .net and .com thing needs  
some fine tuning though, as my previous notes indicated. I don't have  
a parallel printer to print the screens but will scan the screen when  
I get a chance.

The Reply To is for when your want a reply to your E-mail to go  
somewhere else than your BasicISP address like a work E-mail address  
for example.
More later.......

Please consider the environment before printing this email note.

Is there anyway to change the Ports used on the 150?  I think by

I bet y=

You could try adding :587 to the smtp serverna=
me,
but I don't know if that works with the mailstation.

If your isp requi=

port 587, then it won't work anyway, because th=

mailstation can't do that protocol, from what I 
have heard on this list=
.

Well after trying to get Earthlink to turn on a Mailstation 350 unit to an
existing account after the old one got water damaged, I was told that
Earthlink is NOT doing anything more with mailstations.

So if yours is still working you have service, if anything needs to be
changed
on the account, you will no longer have service with them !!!!!


Anybody have any luck on changing the Mailstation 350 unit to another ISP
???

Thanks,
Wayne

I have a unit. Before I trash it, is there any other way to make use of 
it=
? I would not use the service even if I could get it. Surely there is

Which model?

Don't forget, it can be used to send faxes - worth having jus=

You type the message in normally, but enter a phone number instead of an 
email address.

No paper, it can't receive or scan.

Don't forget, people here are working on cracking the code so these can be 
used for various tasks.

It may be possible to add a Basic interpreter and use them as a 
computer/word processor.

Hiya folks, been a while since I posted here.  My work on the
Mailstation a=
nd FyOS pretty much got sidetracked by other things, and I
never did get ba=
ck to it for quite some time.


When the Mailstation did start to pique my =
interest again about a month
ago, I came back to the same conclusion as bef=
ore: ROM locked into the
lower 16KB of address space was a nuisance.  FyOS =
was going to be CP/M
compatible, but it would only ever be able to do so to=
 a certain degree.
Any CP/M application would have to be recompiled at the =
very least
before it would ever work.  That almost defeated the purpose in =
my eyes,
because many programs that a person might want to =A0actually run =
(like
Zork) don't necessarily have source available. =A0Disassembling and
m=
odifying apps to run at a different starting offset would be quite a
chore.=


So since the Mailstation has basically just been laying here collecting
d=
ust, I decided to take the plunge and modify the hardware.  If I
damaged it=
, then so be it. =A0At least I'd still have a keyboard and
LCD to use for a=
nother project, right?

Luckily, that didn't happen!









In a nutshell=
, when the Mailstation starts, everything is as it always
was.  But if ROM_=
TOGGLE is brought high, the code flash ROM is disabled,
and the second 16KB=
 page of SRAM is put into the 0-16KB slot of the
Mailstation.  I made it us=
e the second 16KB SRAM page because the first
page is already in use in the=
 Mailstation's 48-64KB address area. =A0
So basically this means that the e=
ntire 64KB of address space of the
Mailstation can be set to RAM.  And it m=
eans a true CP/M can be run on
it, as well as normal applications. =A0Keep =
in mind though that if one
were to port the original CP/M, they'd still hav=
e to write a BIOS module
to compile into it to support the Mailstation hard=
ware, so it's not as
easy as just dropping a new OS onto it. =A0But I plan =
to continue
developing FyOS now to allow CP/M apps to be run, now that they=
 actually
can be.


I can't solder anytime I want around here, so in the va=
rious windows of
opportunity I get, I've been putting a board together to h=
old the three
logic chips used in my design (1 inverter, 1 AND, 1 OR) so th=
at it can
be tucked back inside the Mailstation.  Using it with the breadbo=
ard is
currently too fragile to really do much with it, so I haven't gone f=
ar
beyond the hardware aspect, other than writing a test app which
continuo=
usly writes three bytes into a particular spot in the lower
16KB, and then =
prints out those locations to the screen.  When
ROM_TOGGLE is low, naturall=
y it will return three bytes from the ROM. 
But when it's high, I get back =
the values I had been writing to the
location (since it's now RAM).

One pr=
oblem at the moment is the toggle of ROM_TOGGLE. =A0Currently,
it's a physi=
cal action on my part to enable the SRAM. =A0I tried
connecting it to vario=
us output pins of the Mailstation's CPU, but the
Mailstation OS must be tog=
gling and setting up these things during its
initialization (thereby switch=
ing ROM out of the address space and
crashing it), because it never starts =
up. =A0The only solution here
that I can think of is to go ahead and replac=
e the Mailstation software
too, to avoid the hardware initialization on wha=
tever pin I want to use.
=A0But I'll take that one step at a time, because =
screwing up the code
flash means a ton of work to wire into the MS board to=
 reflash it. =A0

I'll actually be able to test new startup code by writing=
 it into RAM,
then resetting the Mailstation. =A0It'll then boot off of my =
code
instead of the ROM as long as ROM_TOGGLE is enabled. =A0Once I'm sure
=
my code is good, I'll work on writing it into the code flash.

Anyway, as I=
 said, I still need to finish the circuit board before I
really get back in=
to the software, so I'm hoping to have that done over
the weekend. =A0It's =
just three chips, but cutting, stripping,
arranging, and threading wires on=
to the board takes more time than the
actual soldering. =A0If I had the mon=
ey, I'd have just paid to have a
PCB made, just to avoid dealing with the w=
ires! =A0

I was going to wait to post about it until I had the board made =
and the
Mailstation running a CP/M app, but with the renewed interest and
p=
osting in this group lately, I thought I'd go ahead and chime in, since
I'm=
 excited about where it can go now.

And feel free to ask any questions abo=
ut the hardware if I didn't
explain everything. =A0I can give a detailed ex=
planation of how it
works if necessary. =A0I can also export a circuit sche=
matic if anyone
is interested in building it. =A0But keep in mind that it w=
ill require
cutting traces on the Mailstation board!

True, but Infocom/Zork is one that isn't a problem - we have good clones.

However the best bet would be to add a BASIC (like Microsoft's old one) in 
an unused segment - no problem relocating that.

I wouldn't bother with CP/M.

Welp, I finished it, and it worked on the first try!





Kinda got flash-b=
linded there but you get the idea. I also covered the
back and a small bit =
of the front with a strip of tape so that none of
the exposed metal would t=
ouch anything when inside the Mailstation case.

Downside is, I'm still act=
ivating the ROM toggle manually, which at the
moment means wires sticking o=
ut of the back from the battery compartment
<http://www.fybertech.net/mails=
tation/img/ms_backwires.jpg> . But it'll
have to do for now, because as I m=
entioned before, none of the output
pins from the CPU that I tried will wor=
k without crashing it at startup.
I can devise a test now though to determi=
ne if it's actually the MS
firmware causing it.

I wanted a lot of slack on=
 the wires so that I could work with it
without pulling things loose, but I=
 ended up with a bit of a wire jungle
<http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation=
/img/ms_wirejungle.jpg> . It all
fits back in the case though, just require=
s a minor squeeze to make it
go together to put the screws in.


So once I =
get the Mailstation software issue dealt with, so that I can
tie the ROM_TO=
GGLE pin onto a cpu pin and toggle it via software, it'll
be pretty spiffy.=
 For now I'll probably try to wire a switch into those
three wires to make =
it easier to use, then just put up a prompt for
whenever I need to switch i=
t to RAM.

The funny thing is, if I could afford a GAL programmer, I could =
have
done all of this with a single chip and tons less hassle. =A0But this
=
works for now.

Most of us old TRS-80 guys have a disassembled copy (or two) of the 12 K 
basic with comments. IIRC, there are spare memory blocks in the MS which 
could hold this.

I think CP/M is the way to go. This will give lots of applications
(Wordstar, etc.) and compilers right out of the gate.

A Xilinx CPLD might be the right way to do the hardware mod. That's
what was used for Remem and REX, which are memory/flash upgrades for
the TRS-80 Model 100/102/200.

My understanding is that you can program it in-circuit with a JTAG
cable, no stand-alone programmer necessary.

I ran into a somewhat unexpected snag for one of the things I wanted 
to tr=
y, it would seem.  I was thinking that I could just write some 
code to the=
 SRAM, and while my ROM_TOGGLE hardware was active 
(putting ram page 1 int=
o the 0-16KB slot), that I'd be able to reset 
the Mailstation and then boo=
t code directly out of the RAM for 
testing purposes.  

Well it seems that=
 when I push the reset button in, the thing just 
locks up or something.

M=
y test code is a simple app which disables interrupts, turns the New 
Mail =
LED on, loops through reading port 0x10 to wait 1 second, turns 
the LED ba=
ck off, waits 1 second again, then loops the program.  I 
tested it via the=
 Mailstation Yahoo app loader method and it works as 
expected from there. =
 

I was only using JRs instead of JPs (which I had to disable assembler 
o=
ptimizations to ensure), and disassembled the resulting binary to 
make sur=
e it was doing exactly as I wrote.  So the code was portable 
to any memory=
 location, but resetting the Mailstation didn't execute 
it at startup as e=
xpected.

To make absolute sure there wasn't some hardware problem with run=
ning 
code from the 0x0000 slot when set to RAM, I modified the test app 
w=
ith an ORG 0x0000 and a JP at the end.  That way, after it was 
loaded via =
the Yahoo loader app (into 0x8000, SRAM page 1), it would 
blink the LED on=
ce and use a JP to loop the program, then end up in 
the 0x000 slot (also S=
RAM page 1) to continue execution.  And, as 
expected, it continued to exec=
ute just fine from the first slot.  So 
it wasn't the hardware apparently.
=

So my assumption at this point is that maybe pressing the reset 
button is=
 erasing the contents of the SRAM?  If this is the case, 
what method would=
 be available to reset the system to a default state 
without causing that?=
  And/or would it be possible to stop it from 
erasing the SRAM when pushin=
g the button by modifying it somehow?  I 
haven't traced the connections fr=
om the button to see what all they 
do yet.

I mostly just want to be able =
to get the system into a default 
startup mode when executing my code from =
the SRAM.  That way anything 
I write will be in the same conditions as it =
would be whenever I 
decide to write that code into the code flash, which w=
ould greatly 
improve the chances of not bricking it.

I'm running off of a=
n AC adapter and not batteries, if that possibly 
makes a difference.

Nevermind, I ran into one of those "gotchas" that results from trying 
to u=
se the hardware from the reset state.

Turns out my test code was in fact r=
unning out of RAM at startup.  
But me trying to toggle the LED in that sta=
te wasn't working because 
the P2 direction bits hadn't been initialized.

=
All it took was adding in:

	ld      a, #FF
	out     (#0B), a


I discovere=
d this when looking through Mailstation firmware init 
code, seeing what it=
 did to each port during initialization, and 
noticed the P2 direction regi=
ster.  I assume P2 is all inputs by 
default, hence the LED never coming on=
.


Having to initialize directions for some of the ports has made me 
wond=
er again about what pin could be attached to my ROM_TOGGLE line.  
Currentl=
y I think P28.3 is my best bet.  It's apparently caller ID 
related, but my=
 Mailstation has no caller ID.  All other caller ID 
pins aren't connected =
to anything from the cpu on mine.  Even P28.3 
just goes out to a pad on th=
e back of the board, not connecting to 
anything else, which makes me wonde=
r why they connected that one to 
something but not the others.  But hopefu=
lly it'll be usable for my 
purposes when the Mailstation code isn't fiddli=
ng with it.

Yeah, I think all the ports are input by default.

Add a resistor to pull it to your default=
 state when it
is set as an input.  Then set the bit to the same state,
and=
 then set the dir to output.

I used bit D5 of the par port for my bank swi=
tch
circuit.  IIRC, I connected d5 to the clock on a flip-flop,
and connect=
ed the ms reset line to the ff reset.
A hi then lo pulse on d5 would flip t=
he bank.  I 
used a toggle switch to control whether the normal
(reset) sta=
te was the ms codeflash, or the socket
I kluged in.  Clocking the flip-flop=
 swapped in
the other.

At first I used a boot-rom (mboot) in the socket
to=
 get mailbug going.  Later I put the boot code 
in the ms rom, and a big ra=

The boot code loaded mbug into ms RAM, then swapped
t=

loaded, and RAM in place o=
f the codeflash chip.
Then I could load whatever I wanted into that RAM.
I =
used this setup to run modified versions of the ms
code.  (Breakpoints work=

I used d5 because d0-d4 are used for the updat=

and d6-d7 were in use as a bit-bang serial port.

I ended up doin=

so it wasn't working.  Doh!  I had

Hooray.

What is kind of confusing me though is the resistor value=

use for the pull-down.  I ended up using a 1k, since a 4.7k and =

Pull-down aside, there's three inputs on the logic chips all 
connected =

ROM_TOGGLE is co=

That sounds like a good =
method too, since it resets properly.  Now 
that I'm wired into a CPU port =
to do my switching, pressing the MS 
reset button resets P28 as an input an=
d automatically brings the ROM 
back into slot 0.  In many respects, this i=
s good, since it behaves 
like yours does.  But that also means I can't boo=
t from the RAM now, 
which was one of the things I wanted to be able to do =
easily.

What I think I'll do though is maybe combine a pull-up into the wh=
ole 
mess, connected with a switch.  Not sure what resistor value would 
wo=
rk at the moment considering there's already a pull-down present 
too.  But=
 that way, by flipping the switch, ROM_TOGGLE could be 
forced high regardl=
ess of P28.3 being an input at startup, and I'd be 
able to boot from the R=
AM again when I wanted to test boot code.

Or I dunno, maybe it'd be better=
 to just put the switch between the 
pull-down and ground, since ROM_TOGGLE=
 seems to automatically go high 
when not connected to anything (or when co=
nnected to something set as 
an input).  I dunno if it's good to leave thos=
e inputs floating or 
not though, if it's even still considered floating wh=
en multiple 
inputs are connected like that.

Ha=

what's=
 written to the MS codeflash.  I thought about adding one 
myself, but so m=
any wires involved.  I think I've seen enough to last

what's in those others =

an unimportant section, or on=

certain circumstances.  I mostly only ne=

I thought abo=
ut using a pin from there initially when the others I 
tried didn't work (o=
r more accurately, I didn't know how to make them 
work at the time), but t=
hen I thought that I might want the full 8

You'd need a 5v to 3.3v conversion on power =
and data pins though, 
which is the biggest inconvenience.  I doubt the Mai=

I also considered disconnecting the=
 modem's chip-select and 
connecting address/data/modem CS lines to an IDE-=

in 8-bit data transfer mode from what I understand.  I'd have t=

check CF power requirements though to make sure it wasn't a big 
strain =

nice, because t=

I was gonna say you should check f=

hiding on the ms board somewhere, but read on below...=

Ook!!!  Sounds like you are using TTL logic!!!

I looked at your pictur=
es, and sure enough, I see 74LS parts.
When I said "Add a resistor to pull =
it to your default
state", I was assuming CMOS logic.  I don't even know if=

driving TTL is within spec for the ms cpu.  I assume that
the cpu is CMOS.=
  I would replace the LS parts with
HC or HCT.

Not analog, it's just the design rules are different =
for
TTL than CMOS.  Unconnected TTL inputs "float high", and have
to be act=
ively pulled low.  You usually will not pull a TTL
input low with a resisto=
r (passive).  You either drive it low
with a TTL output, or peg it directly=
 to gnd.  CMOS inputs
don't float high, they are just as happy to float low=
 as hi,
and an unconnected CMOS input will pick up enough influence
just ou=
t of the air to flutter back and forth between lo and hi.
As such, a CMOS i=
nput can be pulled lo or hi with a resistor.

If you change to HC or HCT, then 47k might b=
e good.
I have used 1M when I didn't want to run batteries down
too fast!

=
If you stick with LS, then I would change circuit so
your default was "pull=
ed up" state.  I don't remember
what a typical LS pullup value is.  (IMO, L=
S has been
obsolete for like 20 years or more.)

Might want to make switch select pull-up or pull-do=
wn
(use one res, and spdt switch to select +5 or gnd).
That would avoid pos=
sibility of having p28.3 pegged to
+5v when it is in output mode driving lo=
w.

I learned you should not trust ttl to float hi, you
should al=
ways use a pullup.  I think it is less succeptible
to noise with pullup.  B=
ut when experimenting, letting
them float hi always seemed good enough!

It's not so bad!

(I dunno if =
above embeded image is gonna work.  If
not, you can see it in group's photo=

I found the little gold test points to work better than
the vias=

Offhand I can't say w=
hat part of code you could dump
and still get it to run.  I think the last =
16k page
is empty in most versions of firmware (ok, I only
looked at a few,=
 but I don't remember any that had
code in last page).  Why not use last pa=
ge, and just
reflash the other three pages with code from your dump?

Yeah,=
 even something like a parallel port!  I didn't
make mine with intention of=
 it being anything other
than a research tool to learn about ms insides.
An=
d now that I think about it, the way mine works
you could print to your hea=
rts content, and the
flip-flop is gonna stay flipped.  And you won't
even g=
et a glitch on your printer when flipping
the bank, 'coz bank switching doe=
s not activate
the printer port strobe!

One downside to callid bits is tha=
t some ms's have
the callid chip, so you would have to disable it
on those,=
 I suppose.

That would be p=

of interfacing to USB flash =
drives.  If only I had an

putzing with this stuff anymore, 'coz I got me one of

O=
h wow, somehow I got it into my head that the LS parts were better 
than CM=
OS!  I've mostly messed with older electronic devices, since 
they're usual=
ly the only things easily modifiable for me at this 
point.  And I don't ev=
en have any basic glue logic in 74HC, 
apparently.  I tended to pick up LS =
ones here and there when I'd find 
them cheap from somewhere when getting s=
omething else (to better 
warrant the shipping costs and all), since 74LS i=
s what I've seen 
most of so far (like in the NES).

I already added a pull=
-up into the mix earlier today, with a switch 
between the ROM_TOGGLE and t=
he pull-up resistor.  I tried a 4.7k at 
first, which only half-worked.  Wh=
en I used it to force the 
ROM_TOGGLE line high, I watched my test app disp=
laying bytes from a 
slot 0 memory address, and they constantly jittered ba=
ck and forth 
between devices.  I ended up using a 1k here too, which appea=
red to 
keep the line held solidly.  So the pull-up and pull-down use the 
=
same values.  I guess that means with voltage division that I'm only 
passi=
ng ~2.5v into ROM_TOGGLE, unless the P28.3 and the three TTL 
chip inputs a=
ffect that in ways I don't realize.

I don't really care for using these pa=
rts on the MS now that you've 
made me aware of what a drain they might be,=
 but I guess they'll have 
to do for the time being.  At least I know now! =
 Thanks for the 
enlightenment.

Eventually I'd like to be able to replace =
all of that with a single 
GAL or CPLD anyways, since they seem like they'd=
 be interesting to 
work with considering how many logic chips they would e=
liminate from 
a design.  A board I was making for my NES before would end =
up using 
less than half the chips!

That's yours?  I didn't realize due to t=
he user name.  I thought it 
was someone who came and disappeared from here=
 ages ago.

One thing we've seen at least is that I have a ways to go to ge=
t a 
clean wiring job like that!  I used long wires that twisted onto 
wire=
s coming out of the add-on board because I wanted to be able to 
disconnect=
 it and return the MS to its original state easily if need 
be.  I wasn't e=
ven sure if what I was doing was going to work, after 
all.  It was a relie=
f to see it doing on a breadboard what I had 
planned out, but implementing=
 that on an actual circuit was another 
story.  I've never modified somethi=
ng this modern, now that I think 
about it.  Well, unless you count putting=
 a mod chip on a Gamecube, 
but I didn't design that of course so it hardly=
 counts.

I did notice that 16K chunk.  I w=
as just afraid I might write code to 
erase and rewrite it, but have some u=
nexpected bug maybe and then not 
be able to write the 64K back right away,=
 and take the chance on 
needing that 64K sector to run the Mailstation eno=
ugh to run the 
loader app.  I guess I'll just take the plunge sometime and=
 see how 
it goes!

On the bright side, at least =
you're making money to putz around with 
something at some point with!

USB=
 is even less pins, but I honestly don't know much about it 
myself.  I tri=
ed to work with it via a PIC once to talk to a PC, but 
the protocol confus=
ed me at the time.  I haven't looked at it in a 
long time since then.  I s=
hould learn more about it though, because 
interfacing things with USB coul=
d be neat.

Another thing I thought about in regards to disconnecting the m=
odem 
was to replace it with an actual serial port, which would probably be=
 
much easier to work with than fiddling with the laplink protocol.  I 
hav=
e to admit that the laplink protocol is something that has messed 
with my =
head many times when trying to make sure I had all my data 
signals and par=
allel port pins working together properly, 
particularly since some of them=
 are inverted.  If I ever had to write 
code for a parallel port communicat=
ion method again, I think that 
maybe your serial-like protocol with just a=
 couple of pins might be 
much easier to deal with.

Anyhoo, as for a seria=
l port, I guess the problem that arises is how 
one would deal with flow co=
ntrol and timing.  You'd probably need an 
entire UART and not just some si=
mple level conversion and junk.  
Using a PIC or an AVR might accomplish su=
ch a task, but it's starting 
to add in more complexity and power consumpti=
on than it might be 
worth.

I have a Mailstation 150. If you press and hold Function D while you 
press Reset, you get the menu with "Restore Default Account".
To get to the diagnostic menu, you press Function-Q-A and power, you 
should see a small rectangle in the middle of the screen, then type
"qa781206".

The QA and then the last number sequence has something to do with the serial
number
of the unit.  Take a look at the unit and see if the 781206 is in your
serial number !!!

  I have a Mailstation 150. If you press and hold Function D while you
  press Reset, you get the menu with "Restore Default Account".
  To get to the diagnostic menu, you press Function-Q-A and power, you
  should see a small rectangle in the middle of the screen, then type
  "qa781206".

I picked up a couple of MailStation 120's when they were $9/each, a while b=
ack (three years or more?)  Sitting on a shelf, so far.  I'm interested in =
using the LCD display, keyboard, power system (battery or wall wart) and ca=
se, of course, as part of a new homebrew device that will use a new CPU (de=
solder the old one, replace it.)

I didn't even know this group existed, un=
til today.  Certainly sounds like a start was made here, though there hasn'=
t been much traffic in about a year, now.  I just looked over some of the d=
ocumentation and did find something on the LCD (in .DOC form) here.  (Proba=
bly applies to the 120, but I'm not sure yet.)  A 320x128 graphics LCD is f=
ine for my use, if that's what it is.

What I'm looking for is the more acc=
urate information on schematics, processor pinout and mother board signal a=
ssignments to it, etc., that might relate or help in working out a daughter=
board I can use to replace the CPU unit, together with functional pin descr=
iptions so that I can make reasoned assignments for the new drop-in CPU.  I=
 don't need to know what the old CPU actually was, unless it relates to ada=
pting a new one.  I just need to know the Vcc supply voltage and current co=
mpliance and any special considerations other than that.

My board apparent=
ly uses a Conexant RC224ATL modem/fax chip inside, but for now I don't plan=
 on using it much.  I may, later on, want to use it in conjunction with PCI=
 modem boards I still own for PC desktop computers.  But not for now.  I ma=
y instead set up a USB based custom adapter that attaches to the printer po=
rt for PC communications.  Assuming there is enough information available a=
t this point to do much, at all.  If not, I've got enough work ahead that i=
t will have to wait for Christmas time.

I am decidedly NOT interested in j=
ust adapting this for dialup access to existing services, using the existin=
g software on the unit.  That is of no interest, at all.  I'll do the O/S a=
nd application software for it.

Can anyone give me a boost up on this?  Or=
 has very little really been worked out for these, as yet?

Sorry to distur=
b the lull, but I'm kind of curious about the possibilities and hopeful tha=
t there may be others who can help me skip over some difficulties and who m=
ay also be interested in results I gather over time.  If it's all dead now,=
 that's fine.  I'll just take my time and see where it takes me.

Thanks ve=
ry much to all,
Jon

4.5 years ago now.  Wow, time flies, huh?  :-)

That doc is kinda old now, it has not been updated
regarding the L=
CD in the "new 120" & "new 150".  
The original 120 was in a purple case, a=
nd has LCD
as described in that doc.  The "new 120" is in a dark 
grey case=
 and has a different LCD.

I think that is the modem in the "new 120"=

2400 baud, versus 33k in the "older" models.

Hi Jon,

Great to see n=
ew blood on this project.

Replacing a 100 LQFP processor is not for the fa=
int of heart.
Unless you are going to build a 100 LQFP adaptor, this will b=
e very difficult.

good luck,

many will be watching.

Yes, it's 2400 limited.  S=

modems.  Nice.  I designed a 2400=
 bps, years (nah, decades) ago. Never
tried my hand at the fancy trellis st=

Nothing =
new happening?

I'd like to get complete specs on the various peripheral co=
mponents
that exist surrounding the micro.  I'd like to get the datasheet o=
n
the micro, itself, so that I can see what internal peripheral support
it =
has and how it is attached to the rest.  I'd like to get the
protocols used=
 for the LCD (does it have it's own controllers?  if so,
which?  if not, wh=
at are the details for the LCD in terms of timing
diagrams and the like?)  =
Etc.

Here's what I want eventually to do.  I've two things in mind (one is=

a BASIC interpreter and using the printer port for an I/O bus for
extender=
 boards.)  Both depend on getting a decent, modern development
setup for it=
, though.  So for now, the main thing is to design a
daughter board to repl=
ace the existing cpu.  Or else get some
convincing evidence that I should j=
ust keep it there.

It might be smarter for me to first use SDCC with the e=
xisting system
until I gain enough experience with it.  But right now, I'm =
not sure
how to proceed there.  I gather already that the CPU core is Z80-l=
ike,
but that doesn't tell me a great deal by itself.  (I used to do a lot
=
of 8080 and 8085 programming before the Z80 even existed and got my
hands o=
n Z80 assembly work with the TRS-80, memory serving.)  I have
SDCC loaded, =
already, and integrated into the SiLabs IDE for
compilation, right now.  I =
can use it with a DOS box, though.  Anyway,
how does compiled output (hex f=
iles, perhaps?) get burned into the
system?  Is there a mechanism that's be=
en worked out and works well?
What hardware tools are involved in that?  Et=
c.

If I do this way first, it will allow me a 'slow ramp' into
understandi=
ng the hardware details more intimately, before deciding if
I should jump o=
ff the cliff and place another CPU in there.  An
extremely low power one wo=
uld be the MSP430 (has extremely good start
up from sleep times) or some of=
 the newer PICs or even the SiLab parts
(one I'm using now is about the onl=
y thing going for a decent 1MHz
16-bit SAR ADC no matter what family you wa=
nt to talk about.)  Atmel
has some interesting parts, as well.  And there a=
re many, many ARM
choices -- though most suck a little too much power for m=
y taste.  I
like things under 2mA on the CPU when it is running full out an=
d under
10uA with a decent timer or two plus brown-out and a comparator
run=
ning.  So that drops ARMs out, mostly.  But I love the parts
because of the=
 great compiler support from gcc.

Anyway, I started to read today.  I supp=
ose I can slog through on my
own, if you assure me a lot is out there to re=
ad.  But if you can
point me faster, I'd sure appreciate that a lot.  The f=
aster I figure
out the barriers, the faster I can get going.

Also, do you =
know where one can pick up more of these new 120's?  Or
new 150's?  Cheap! =
 I picked up two at $5 and I just found another I
can get at the same price=
, still in the box.  But if I do this, I
might want to make 100 or so.  (Sc=
hool stuff, teaching tool of sorts.)
Since I'd give them away, they need to=
 be cheap.  If you know of any
nice stockpile of them that hasn't been grou=
nd into powder already and
where the owner might consider getting at least =
'something' rather
than having to pay for garbage disposal to get back the =
shelf space,
I'd like to know about it.

Thanks for the quick response!

100 pins isn't that scary.  It would be the spacing that mi=

I was thi=

Of course, I'm also interested in just learning =

Someone was wo=
rking on getting CP/M going, but as you noted,
there has been no traffic on=
 list in last year.

And it's been over a year since I did anything on this=
 project.

I was working up a c header to use the mailstation rom
functions=
 that I had figured out (and I figured out
quite a bit, if I do say so myse=
lf!)   :-)

It's in file section, under "Mailstation Toolkit".

I have some=
 stuff I didn't upload, in particular a 
perl script I was working on, to c=
onvert resource strings 
& graphics into format that works with the mailsta=
tion 
lib functions.  You just link the resource data with
your c code, usi=
ng sdcc.

And I was working on a makefile to compile mailstation 
apps with=
 sdcc.

I am pretty sure that everything known about the hardware is
i=
n the file area, in particular the "part files" folder.

Also, there is a l=
ist of known models in the group's database 
section, where some of the dif=
ferences are documented.

There are manufacturer datasheets for representat=
ive codeflash,
dataflash, and ram chips, and a few on some of the modems.
T=
here are notes on the cpu, lcd, and keyboard, where we never 
found actual =
datasheets.  AFAICT, they are good enough, and
not having actual datasheets=
 is not holding anything back.

I suppose the main thing lacking is data on=
 the blue LCD.

The mailstation models are all quite similar (except 350). =
 
The differences I can think of off hand are:
 Various manufacturers of me=
mory chips.
 Ergonomic models have a slightly different keyboard matrix.
 1=
20 & 150 both were made with two kinds of LCD.
 Caller ID chip only in whit=
e/cream colored units.
 Various modem chips (diff speeds)
 250 has cordless=
 phone chipset.
 Probably at least 20 different firmware versions.

The sim=
ilarities (except 350, and diff noted above):
 One Megabyte codeflash.
 512=
 KByte dataflash.
 128 KByte ram.
 All have same cpu (z80 inst set).
 Port =
& Memory Maps are all the same.
 320 x 128 monochrome LCD (but 2 diff types=
 exist).
 Parallel port.

I'm just going from memory, and it has been a few=
 years.
Perhaps I remember it wrong in some cases???

My feeling is that it would be quite hard to replace the cpu,
and if =
you did, you would have a powerful cpu with a tiny monochrome
LCD (not even=
 grayscale).  Perhaps you could program the  ms as a
terminal for more powe=
rful processor?  Bear in mind what you
can buy a netbook, or used notebook =
for.

By the way, the cpu is 128 pins, and small enough to hide under a dim=
e.
I can't think of an easy (and good, and cheap) way to connect a 
sub-boa=
rd.  But you could put new cpu inside case, and still connect 
it as a term=
inal (fewer wires).

The most recent method I used involved poking a =
few bytes into
dataflash with ms built-in hex-editor, and loading a larger
=
block of code into the ms splash-screen file with "mailbug", a
debugger for=
 ms that I wrote (in file section).  The code entered
via hex-editor is in =
location ms uses for "loadable apps", and
when you run that short "app", it=
 jumps to the larger block in the 
splash-screen area of the dataflash.

I'=
m a little fuzzy on exactly the steps, but I used the code in
splash-screen=
 to load another app into the app area of the
dataflash.  This one shows up=
 with an icon in the ms menu,
and it interfaces with mailbug to load other =
apps.
Since it is in dataflash, it is persistent (I didn't
have to go thru =
this whole procedure every time I loaded 
a new program.)

So, then I could=
 click on this "bootloader" icon in ms menu,
and then load hex files over a=
 laplink cable, using
mailbug on the PC end.

I didn't write a bootloader t=
o load directly to dataflash.
I was loading apps into ms ram with mailbug, =
executing them, 
then a small piece of code included in app copied the app =

from ram to another empty app slot in dataflash.  Whew!  
But it worked!!!=
  :-)

Oh yeah, I executed at a special entrypoint to run the 
"install" co=
de, which would call ms firmware to copy the
ram image to the dataflash.  A=
fter it had been copied 
to dataflash, when running the loaded app from the=
 ms menu, 
app would start from the normal entrypoint (iow, the first byte)=
.

Earlier methods involved overwriting the codeflash with
similar bootload=
er, but that killed the ms for normal
operation as a mailstation.

The proc=
ess is documented somewhere in file section, or
possibly in a message post =
(almost 2 yrs ago, aprrox).
I'll see if I can find it, if I ever finish rea=
ding/responding 
to this message. ;-)

One thing on my todo list (that I di=
d not do yet) was to make
a simpler command-line loader that could run from=
 the
makefile, when you did "make program", so I could compile
and load fro=
m ide, without needing separate mailbug prog.

When I was working under win=
dows, I used the winavr IDE.
Lately I am using Ubuntu, where at first I use=
d 
"gedit" as IDE, but recently I found "geany" which I 
really like.  It i=
s somewhat similar to winavr's 
"programmers notepad", in that it is based =
on same 
editor engine.  But it seems like a more polished 
program, with m=
ore features (better find command, 
for one).

Perhaps the reason the ARM sucks up more p=
ower running full speed
is because full speed on ARM is a lot faster than t=
he others???

I don't know much about MSP430 other than it is a popular cho=
ice.
I like AVRs, mostly because I am comfortable with avr-gcc.
I have an i=
tch to learn more about ARM, but so far have not
used any of them.  PICs ar=
e popular, but I can't figure out
just why.  I have been avoiding PICs, and=
 intend to continue
avoiding.

Gosh, I c=
an't assure you there's "a lot".  My feeling is there is
a lot of crud to w=
ade through!  And by "crud", I mean a lot of 
yammering about using the mai=
lstation for email.  ;^)

If you notice any outright spam still there, jot =
down the msg#.  
The file sections I mentioned probably have higher signal-=
to-noise 
ratio than most of the message archive.
There probably is some co=
de in the message archive that is not
in the files, but whether it is impor=
tant, I dunno.

I don't think fyberoptic put his stuff in yahoo group files=
, so
you might look for his url.  Or google [fyberoptic mailstation].
His s=
tuff was oriented towards running code from ram, more like a
desktop comput=
er (and without ms code), while my stuff was aimed 
at running from flash, =
like an embedded-system (and running 
under mailstations "OS").

That's the best deal I've heard of.  They a=

usually at least $10 with shipping.  I imagine yo=

I have a closet full, but I am =

girlfriend likes to tease me about them... H=

No problem.

I set the group to "new users moderated" s=
everal months ago,
and you are the first (besides a couple spammers) to pos=
t
under that setting.  I thought it was supposed to automatically
turn mode=
ration off when first post was approved, but for
some reason your messages =
this morning (uh, yesterday morn now)
still went into mod folder.  I'll see=
 if I can change it 
manually if any more go there.

From my point of view, two things would be ideal:

1) Some sort of set up where an email could be sent to the MS which
would 'unlock' any model from EarthLink and let you use any dial up
ISP.

2) A hardware system which would let you flash the ROM to add or alter
functionality and make any model much more useful.

My concern now, having been through this before, is that EarthLink
will junk all of the documentation etc for these and it will be lost
forever. They still do support these but for how much longer?

That already exists for my model, the 'new' 120.  I use=

instructions I found and they worked perfectly on my unit.  (Well, t=

Yes.  =
That's something I would expect as a first step.  I take it,
that hasn't be=

I'm not much interested in usin=
g these with Earthlink or any other
dial-up service.  Too much pain/cost th=
ere.  Dialup is likely to go
away, completely, anyway.  It costs a lot to m=
aintain the phone banks,
modems, etc., and people are moving towards cell p=
hones as their
primary phone service, as well.  How many more years it will=
 last, I
don't know.  But there is a lot of financial pressure, I bet, to d=
ump
it entirely.

I would like to support a USB connection to the computer =
for file
exchange (make it appear like a FAT-file memory stick to the PC.) =
 And
set up a bootstrap that would allow me to specify boot parameters for

loading specific files from the flash file system on startup.
Something aki=
n to the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT of DOS days, I
suppose.  That would be=
 convenient enough that anyone could use it.
The other option, as you menti=
on, is hardware for flashing directly.
Start there, work towards the USB so=
lution, I suppose.

So nothing much has been done along these lines, I gath=
er.

Hi Jon,

The Mail Station is just a toy that has been fun, but now is obs=
oleted by 32 bit Wireless devices.

The amount of work is not really a prob=
lem.

Its the amount of return.

I have looked at replacing the main board =
with something else.

I measured out the main board in one of my wrecked ma=
chines to use the LCD, keyboard and power supply connections.

I figured it=
 would cost about $200-400 just to get something running.

For less than $1=
00 I got a ZipIt wireless device.
That killed the Mail Station for me.

://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/zipitwireless/

So, I am sorry if I spoiled =
your fun.

Actually, that's a great reference and not a problem, at all.  I'm

glad you mentioned it.

I still would like to play around with the 120 some=
 more (and I will,
I think, if I can get sufficiently educated to do someth=
ing sensible
with it.)

Thanks,
Jon

Oh, my.  A full-sized keyboard is pretty much a requirement in my
case.=
  Are these as tiny as they look??  And they seem to use backlit

for me.  Inter=

Hiya folks, been a while since I checked here.  Nice to see there's at
leas=
t been a few posts recently, though!

Anyhow, I was trying to get a version=
 of CP/M written a while back for
the Mailstation, and even did that hardwa=
re mod for banking out the
first 16KB of address space with ram just specif=
ically for that.  But
then a combination of distractions as well as the lof=
ty goals of writing
like a storage system for the Flash memory and everythi=
ng just kind of
pulled me away from Mailstation work.

Part was laziness to=
o though, I admit, since it's tedious to write code
on the PC, compile, tra=
nsfer it to the Mailstation, see if it works.  If
not, try to debug what ha=
ppened by trying to write things to the screen,
etc.  And even then you're =
not getting all the information you might
want for debugging purposes, espe=
cially if you crashed it.  Definitely a
pain.

So recently, when the notion=
 of messing around with the MS again started
rattling around in my head, I =
realized that the only reasonable way for
me to continue developing anythin=
g elaborate was to emulate the hardware
on the PC.  More lofty goals!

But =
the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the hardest
part was =
going to be the CPU.  And as luck would have it, I found
something called l=
ibz80 to do the job for me.  It has hooks for
reading/writing memory and I/=
O, which works great for all the
device/page switching that the Mailstation=
 does.

Well, turns out, libz80 has a ton of emulation bugs, which were mes=
sing
me up for a few days.  I've corrected many of them in the source (it's=

very well written and easy to modify compared to another z80 emulation
lib=
rary I saw), and notified the author, who seemed eager to get a fixed
versi=
on up as soon as possible.

So now, after much debugging and digging throug=
h assembly output, I've
successfully gotten to what appears to be a Mailsta=
tion error screen,
and then the cpu is intentionally halted. =A0Here's an i=
mage:



I have no idea what is resulting in the behavior at this point, bu=
t it's
the first visible indication of progress so far, so I thought I'd sh=
are
it for anyone interested.

As for the technical details:

- The Mailsta=
tion memory map is properly emulated, with codeflash page 0
in the first 16=
K, and RAM page 0 in the last 16K.
- Device/page switching via I/O ports is=
 functional for the middle two
16K slots
- Devices emulated so far: RAM (re=
ad/write), Codeflash (read), Dataflash
(read/write), LCD (write)
- Dataflas=
h has sector-erase and byte-program chip functions emulated
- LCD is curren=
tly written into buffers (one for each LCD half), and
later dumped to separ=
ate files. =A0The LCD CAS bit is properly emulated
to make this possible. =
=A0I've written a separate utility to convert
the raw binary files into vie=
wable BMP images.



I've started writing in PDCurses support to give a deb=
ugger interface. 
Though I've also done /raw and /silent command line switc=
hes.  The
former dumps disassembly and debug output straight to the screen,=
 which
can be redirected to a file.  The latter disables all output, speedi=
ng
emulation up considerably.  I've actually done 100% of my debugging so
f=
ar by using /raw and dumping to a text file, which has grown upwards to
200=
MB!  I'm hoping to get the debugging interface working eventually to
avoid =
this roundabout way of doing it.

Another possibly interesting tidbit is th=
at I'm modifying the codeflash
at emulator startup, and changing the Mailst=
ation's delay() function to
simply RET immediately.  It was outputting tons=
 of useless information
during that call.  I don't think this will hurt my =
emulation at all,
especially since I'm not even emulating interrupts/timers=
 yet.

I'm running on the Mailstation v2.53 firmware for this, with a dataf=
lash
dump I made from my v3.03 firmware.  I have no idea if this will cause=

issues, but it's the only dataflash image I have.  The reason I'm using
th=
e 2.53 firmware is because I have a very commented disassembly file of
code=
flash page 0 for that version, which has helped a ton in debugging. 
I woul=
d love to have more disassembled pages with comments like this, if
anyone h=
as them!  I've spent a lot of time commenting some of the later
pages mysel=
f to the best of my ability, which has slowed me down a lot.

Anyhow, the n=
ext biggest thing is to get the LCD actually emulated
visually in real-time=
.  In order to make it all as cross-platform as
possible, I might be able t=
o do it with SDL, but I'll have to see what I
can do.

The other big thing =
is to track down why the Mailstation is halting
after showing this screen. =
 It'll take a lot more digging through
disassembled Mailstation source I gu=
ess, since the initialization
routine it was running was in another page of=
 the codeflash.  But I'm
still making progress, albeit slowly!

I've made some progress, after muchhhh firmware disassembly, tracing
throu=
gh the startup procedure. =A0

First up, I've gone to SDL for graphics, so =
now the LCD can be updated
in mostly real-time (not too often though or it =
slows down emulation
considerably).

I emulated the power and battery bits =
of port 9, so that it actually
thinks it's not about to burn out. =A0This g=
ot rid of the previous
screen I was seeing (which I assume was a low batter=
y warning, despite
the missing text), and now simply displayed the logo ins=
tead (without
the blank message box on top) before halting.

So after a whi=
le of more tracing through things, I realized that maybe I
just needed to w=
arm-boot the system, since it does have a cold-boot
procedure too, and it s=
eemed to be running this every time (messing with
dataflash, setting up ram=
, etc). =A0So upon receiving the CPU halt, I
told it to simply reboot autom=
atically instead (keeping ram/dataflash
changes intact). =A0Then, low and b=
ehold:






Same shot as above, except from the v3.03 firmware:






I th=
ink maybe an interrupt automatically wakes it back up normally
instead of h=
aving to push the power button again? =A0I'll have to look
into it more. =
=A0


Anyway, I tried the v3.03 firmware again to see if that would make a
=
difference due to the dataflash image I'm using, but I still get the
reset =
menu. =A0Which I later remembered is what normally happens when
you cold-bo=
ot a Mailstation. =A0

I also tried setting the "bootstate" ram byte to 0x5=
a at startup to
avoid all the cold-boot initialization stuff, to maybe get =
straight to
the main menu, but it just perpetually reboots then. =A0I'm obv=
iously
missing something it needs/wants to work properly in that respect.

=
So it looks like the next step is to properly emulate keypresses, in
order =
to get past this screen! =A0That'll require triggering an
interrupt too. =
=A0Only part I'm worried about is that I seem to recall
the key scanning fu=
nction relies on a timer to know how long you've held
down a key, and I don=
't know if I'll ever be able to emulate that with
complete accuracy (especi=
ally since the Z80 cpu library I'm using just
emulates instructions, not cl=
ock cycles). =A0But we'll see.

I'm compiling/running it under Windows at the mom=

A little more progress.

Turns out, the Mailstation halting after showing t=
he logo was simply
standard routine.  The firmware runs through the message=
 loop checking
for things to do, and when there are no more, it HALTs the C=
PU.  The
rest of the hardware stays running, while the CPU waits for an int=
errupt
to wake it up.  When that happens, the interrupt routine is triggere=
d,
new events are possibly added to the message queue based on what the
int=
errupt was, and then it returns into the message loop to do it all
over aga=
in.

Originally, I was resetting the Mailstation emulation after getting
st=
uck at the logo, and then managing to get to the settings reset menu. 
Turn=
s out, when I manually pumped a bunch of keyboard interrupts while
at that =
logo screen (repeatedly running the message loop again), it kept
doing thin=
gs.  It eventually popped a dialog box up:



Yet again, there's no text, j=
ust like in that low battery warning I got
originally.  I don't know what's=
 wrong with that aspect.  Maybe there's
still a bug in the Z80 emulation?? =
 Anyway, eventually I deduced that
this must be a configuration error dialo=
g (since I'm using dataflash
from a different firmware version).  But, I ha=
d no way to push the
button to continue.

Meanwhile, I came up with a crude=
 way to emulate hardware timing, by
incrementing a counter every time a byt=
e is read or written from address
space (this happens when reading in instr=
uctions as well as data).  So
from there, I was able to implement a time16 =
and a keyboard interrupt to
happen automatically, intertwined with port 3's=
 interrupt mask to know
whether they should be triggered (and handle when a=
n interrupt gets
"reset" during the interrupt routine).  So now the error d=
ialog
eventually popped up automatically whenever I started up the emulator=
. 
But I still couldn't press enter to bypass it.  Resetting the
Mailstatio=
n still took me to that "Reset Settings" menu, mind you, but I
couldn't do =
anything there either.

So, I put together a way to emulate the keyboard ma=
trix hardware
(required ORing and ANDing of values to respond to how the Ma=
ilstation
checks the whole grid at a time to see if it even needs to proces=
s
individual keys), and then quickly tacked in support for the enter key
ba=
sed on my actual keyboard's input.  Due to the slowness of emulation
at the=
 moment, I had to hold the key in just slightly longer than on the
real har=
dware, but it totally worked.  It closed the error dialog, and
moved along:=




I really need to figure out why the text isn't printing.  But yeah, it'=
s
obviously the configuration screen.  I just can't type in any settings
ye=
t since the enter key is all that's tied to my actual keyboard.  When
you k=
eep pressing it, the cursor jumps to each setting's area on the
screen, and=
 eventually jumps to the top again.  I've gotta come up with
a way to trans=
late PC scancodes to the memory array I'm using to
replicate the keyboard m=
atrix, then I should be all set on input.


Well, then I had a thought.  If=
 v2.53's firmware didn't like my
dataflash and wanted me to reset everythin=
g, then what would happen with
the v3.03 firmware which actually goes with =
that dataflash image?  Turns
out, it must like it just fine, because I'm ge=
tting no errors.  But I'm
not getting anything else, either.  While sitting=
 at the logo screen, it
waits for keyboard interrupts to happen for a littl=
e while, and then
eventually changes the interrupt mask to 0x39 (00111001).=
  That means
it's no longer listening for the keyboard (which normally trig=
gers 64
times a second I think).  From what we know (or what I know based o=
n
stuff from here), these interrupts on now are "null", "null", "time16",
a=
nd "maybe rtc".  My time16 interrupt keeps going off approximately once
a s=
econd (since I believe that was the proper rate), at least.  I tried
manual=
ly triggering rtc interrupts, but haven't gotten anything to
happen.  So I =
don't know what's going on at this point without more
disassembling.

Here'=
s the v3.03 firmware logo if anyone's interested:



It might be worth noti=
ng that if I use garbage for dataflash with v3.03
instead of the image file=
 I have of it, then I get identical behavior to
v2.53 so far: an error dial=
og after the logo, and then proceeding to the
configuration window upon pre=
ssing enter.  So I'm left to assume that
even when v2.53's configuration is=
 set (once I get more keyboard
support), then I'll get stuck at the startup=
 somewhere too.

Anyway, I guess that's all I got for now.  I just really w=
ant to fix
that text rendering problem!

Yeah I don't =

I saw your message the other night, and was stuck tryi=
ng to think 
of why the dialog box popped up.
And then I fell asleep before=
 finishing the post I was working on...

Yeah, that's why it halts.  

It n=
ever occured to me that it had emptied the event queue, and 
was supposed t=
o halt.  I have no guess why the text is not printing.

I was going to ment=
ion that you will not get past the splash screen
until you emulate the 60 H=
z interrupt.  In addition to scanning
the keyboard, it also increments a se=
t of ten timers, and these
timers are used whenever they put something on t=
he screen that
needs to change after some delay.  Such as the splash being
=
erased, and moving on to the main menu (or user select sometimes).

They se=
t a timer, and return to the os.  (As Mr. Popeil says, 
"you just set it...=
 and forget it!!!)  They never just spin in 
a delay loop.  And when the os=
 has another event for that app, 
the os calls the app, passing the event a=
s param.

Any app that uses timers also implements a response for timer
eve=
nts.  The splash is a simple  app that just displays
the splash image, sets=
 timer, and then when it gets the timer 
event, it makes a call that change=
s the current app to
either the main menu, or if there is more than one use=
r, 
the select user app (or when no user accts are set up yet, 
the create =
user app).

> this must be a configuration error dialog (since I'm using da=
taflash

I think you can wipe the da=
taflash, and it will init it.  IIRC, the
flag that holds the dataflash stat=
e is in 2nd to last sector of dataflash (about 10 bytes at start of sector,=
 and nothing else in
rest of sector (or not much else????).  Preserve the l=
ast sector,
that is where your serial number is stored.  IIRC, the "flash
t=
est" that you can run from test mode walks on all but that 
last sector wit=
h the "test data".  Everything but the serial number
will be re-intiialized=
 after the test.  If you have any apps in
the loadable-app space, you can s=
kip wiping them, and I think
they will survive the re-init (I could be wron=
g.  The flash test
does wipe that area of dataflash).  It is very possible =
that
zeroing out the first 2 bytes in 2nd to last dataflash sector is
all y=
ou need to do to cause it to be re-init'ed (not sure tho).

> from there, I=
 was able to implement a time16 and a 
> keyboard interrupt to

I don't rec=
all ever finding anything that used "time16".  It
just increments a 16 bit =
counter every time that int is received,
but I never found anything that us=
ed that count value.

"Time32" (named simply 'coz it was 32 bits, v/s 16 bi=
ts) is used
for a lot of stuff.  It gets incremented by 16 by the same
int =
as keyscan.  The keyscan int is roughly 60 Hz, or about
a 16 millisecond pe=
riod, so "time32" is roughly in milliseconds.

That 60 Hz interrupt does 3 =
things: 
1) the keyscan.
2) increments time32 by 16.
3) increments each of =
ten timers......
Wait... I'll go out and come in again...

That 60 Hz inter=
rupt does 12 things: 
1) the keyscan.
2) increments time32 by 16.
3 thru 12=
) increments each of ten timers by 1.

It's not clear to me if the P3-out is a "mask", or if it is just
used to =
reset the corresponding bit of the register that feeds
P3-in (where P3 in b=
its are set by the various int inputs).

<kluge>
You could just=
 disable the keyscan, and replace it with code
that reads an unused port, a=
nd calls the put_key_in_buffer
routine with that value.  The emulation for =
that new port
could just feed the keycodes for any keys pressed on pc kbd.
=
I don't remember for sure what is stored in that keybuffer, 
though.  It mi=
ght be the row/col data, along with up/down/shift
info.
That would make it =
a bit harder, possibly even worse than actually 
scanning an emulated keybo=

I think=
 the only one that is important at this point is the 
60 Hz keyscan-etc.  T=
he rtc might be important as far as 
waking up the cpu at the set mail-down=
load time, and for the 
date and time to be set right when you power up, bu=
t as far as emulating, prolly not too important.

This is probably what it is supposed to do.  The =
user acct data
is in the dataflash, so if the dataflash is trashed, after i=

You need to set some breakpoints, or at least "flagpoints".=

I would prolly just compile some in to the code, but you 
could also make =
commandline switches, or a config file.

The idea being to whittle down you=
r log to a comprehensible
size.  So, you set some addresses that you are in=
terested to
know if it is getting to.  You can have it just log the 
addres=
ses on your "watch list", in the order it gets to them.

Maybe a different =
switch to stop at certain addresses.  Then 
you can box in the code where t=
he text is supposed to be copied,
and even dump the addresses involved (thi=
rd switch).

I bet it is gonna turn out to be some kind of banking error.
T=
here are many places where a codeflash page needs to be banked
in, just to =
copy a string from that page to a local ram var.

(OK, at the top, where I =
said "the other night", add another 
night to that, coz it's now "tommorow"=
 and I still have not 
hit "send")

I suppo=

to have a=
 username/password to log into the email account, and I doubt
they cared wh=
at Mailstation unit you logged into the official
Mailstation email server w=

the server when fetching/sendi=

Something like Tivo on the other hand has the serial on an eprom=
, since
that's tied directly to your account.  Even if you replace the hard=

drive, it's still going to work with your account afterward.  Though
peopl=
e have managed to clone those in order to transfer their account to
another=
 one when the system board dies.

Ho=
w did you deduce that the keyboard interrupt was 60hz?  I'm curious,
since =
I've seen you mention that before, but I have some evidence that
might prov=
e otherwise.  Some of it I came to realize just yesterday,
even.

Before, w=
hen I was doing all that work on the Mailstation and hooking
the ISR for te=
sting things, I placed a counter variable inside the
keyboard loop.  All it=
 did was count up.  I called it kbdtest.  In the
time16 interrupt, I would =
copy the value of kbdtest into kbdmax, then
reset kbdtest to 0.  kbdmax wou=
ld be displayed on the screen in separate
code outside the ISR.  Since time=
16 apparently hit at exactly 1 second
intervals (because I believe I timed =
it by hand as such), then kbdmax
would be a semi-accurate way of determinin=
g the speed of the keyboard
interrupt.

As it turned out, kbdmax was result=
ing in a constant value of 64.  So
the keyboard interrupt appeared to be ha=
ppening 64 times a second, 64hz,
etc.

And now recently, when searching for=
 possible info on the RTC of the
Mailstation (or one similar), I came upon =
something rather interesting. 
It appears that many RTC chips have a progra=
mmable square wave
generator, in hz.  With values like 16, 32, 64, 128, 256=
, etc.  This
made me think that maybe the keyboard interrupt is being gener=
ated by
programmable RTC.

More possible proof of this is when I was tinker=
ing with port 0x2F a
long time ago.  This is what I learned back then:

- S=
etting bits 4,6 makes time16 interrupt 2x slower (kbdmax =3D 128)
- Setting=
 bits 5,6 makes time16 interrupt 4x slower (kbdmax =3D 256)
- Setting bits =
4,5,6 makes time16 interrupt 8x slower (kbdmax =3D 512)
- When bit 6 is cle=
ar, but 4, 5, or both are set, time16 interrupt
doesn't seem to ever occur.=


Well, back then, I naturally assumed that changing 0x2F was affecting
the=
 time16 interval.  But now, after learning of these programmable
square wav=
es, maybe 0x2F is changing the speed of the keyboard
interrupt, not the tim=
e16 one.  It would make sense if so.  Let me
clarify:

Now remember, kbdtes=
t was incrementing in the keyboard interrupt, and
kbdmax was saving this va=
lue in the time16 interrupt.  Original
assumption was 0x2F was slowing time=
16, hence more opportunity for
kbdtest to reach a higher value before time1=
6 hit and saved the value. 
Well, what if you turn that around, and assume =
that it's affecting the
keyboard interrupt instead of time16, making it hap=
pen FASTER, thereby
causing kbdtest to count faster, which is then recorded=
 to kbdmax at
what is likely still the normal 1 second interval of time16.
=

If so, that would mean:
- Setting bits 4,6 makes keyboard interrupt happen=
 128hz
- Setting bits 5,6 makes keyboard interrupt happen at 256hz
- Settin=
g bits 4,5,6 makes keyboard interrupt happen at 512hz

These values corresp=
ond to what many RTC square waves are capable of
emitting (along with the 6=
4hz I've assumed Mailstation normally runs the
keyboard at).  I looked at s=
everal RTC chips, and many had this
programmability, but I couldn't ever fi=
nd one with similar registers as
what the Mailstation's uses.  Particularly=
, they store the two BCD
values for secs/mins/hours/etc in a single byte at=
 a particular I/O
port, where as the Mailstation seems to store each indivi=
dual BCD digit
in two separate ports, based on what's been documented so fa=
r.

Anyway, I guess the only way to prove any of this is true would be for
=
me to display the value of time16 on the screen constantly, while
changing =
0x2F.  If 0x2F is in fact affecting the speed of the keyboard
interrupt, th=
en printing time16 on the screen constantly would still
show its value upda=
ting in 1 second increments no matter what.  If my
new assumption is wrong,=
 meaning it's affecting time16 instead like I
originally assumed, then the =
counter on the screen would happen slower. 
I'll try this sooner or later t=
o see how it goes.

Either way, I just wanted to point out why I think norm=
ally the keyboard
interrupt happens at 64hz instead of 60, but I'm still cu=
rious of your
reasoning in case I'm still missing something.

I think I may have tested this before, but I don't remember.  Either
wa=
y, all a person needs to do is hook the ISR, and make a value
increment in,=
 say, the keyboard interrupt.  Then change the interrupt
mask to disable ke=
yboard interrupts.  If the value stops counting, then
you know the mask is =
in fact disabling that interrupt.  Whenever I get
around to writing the cod=
e again to check the time16 rate when changing
0x2F, I'll check this too.

It's funny you even mention that, because honestly th=
at was my first
thought: to just dump keys straight into the buffer.  But t=
his would
only work for emulating the Mailstation OS, and I eventually want=
 all of
my custom code to work with it as closely to the real hardware as
p=
ossible.  So I did end up creating a translation table, which wasn't as
bad=
 as I thought, actually.  I used an array of 10 rows/8 columns, which
store=
s the PC scancode for each associated key of the Mailstation key
matrix.  I=
 have to scan through the array's rows and columns every time
a key is pres=
sed/released to match it with a scancode in the array (so
80 iterations, to=
ps).  But once it's found, I can then easily take the
row/column values fro=
m the loop to update the actual bitwise matrix
array (which is just 10 byte=
s representing the rows, since each column
is an individal bit), which is w=
hat I use to then actually emulate the
output of port 1 (based on the input=
 of port 1, 2.0, and 2.1).

Not every MS key is emulated yet, and some have=
 been put elsewhere
("Home" is the Home key, though "Back" is the End key).=
  I'm going to
emulate "Function" as the Control key eventually too, but fo=
r now
control combos are how I send special commands to my emulator, so I'l=
l
have to change that.

As I mentioned earlier, I was looking into a lot of different=
 RTC chips,
and most of them did have an alarm feature.  So that might be t=
ied to
that interrupt strictly to wake it up to check for mail, as you
ment=
ioned.  Makes a lot of sense.

Well that's the thing, I do have=
 timers working.

But, now that the keyboard is emulated, at a cold boot I =
can enter
configuration info (even though I can't see it as I type it, unle=
ss I
type so much that it scrolls off to the right; but I can see password
=
asterisks fine).  I save, and get to the user selection screen:



and then=
 to the main menu:





I can even use most of the items in the menu withou=
t issue (aside from
some missing text at times, and the create new mail app=
 crashing).  This
is on v2.53 firmware btw.

But, when I soft-reset after c=
onfiguring it, my original assumption was
correct: v2.53 sticks at the spla=
sh screen, just like v3.03 did with the
proper dataflash configuration alre=
ady there.  I even tried changing the
emulator to always fire keyboard/time=
16 interrupts regardless of the
interrupt mask, and it makes no difference.=


I discovered something shortly ago, however.  I was originally assuming
t=
hat the Mailstation was changing the interrupt mask from 0x22 to 0x39. 
But=
 I added in a feature to the emulator to dump ram with a keypress. 
So, I d=
ump ram while the interrupt mask is still 0x22, and then again
when the mas=
k changes to 0x39.  Turns out, it's not changing the mask. 
It's changing E=
VERYTHING to 0x39.  Ram page 1 is totally full of it, and
page 0 is almost =
entirely, aside from values which I assume are getting
set during the messa=
ge queue loop and such when the interrupt hits.

And you know what?  I bet =
I just figured out what it is, because there's
a few 0x39s even in my first=
 ram dump.  Right before they start, there's
"Jan ".  I bet it's reading th=
e RTC and I'm returning invalid value(s)!

YEP!  I just now tried it, retur=
ning 0x01 for ports 0x10 through 0x1C,
and now it warm boots just fine!  Ev=
en the create new mail app works now
(since it was prolly reading the date/=
time to know what to put in the
email).

All unhandled IO ports are actuall=
y just handled like RAM: stored in and
returned with an array, which I zero=
 out at startup.  So it was
returning 0 for all RTC values originally, whic=
h obviously was breaking
something.  I think I'm actually going to tie the =
Mailstation RTC to my
PC's clock so that it's always correct, once I figure=
 out how to
represent all the values (and converted to BCD).

So now, aside=
 from things like the modem, printer port, etc, it seems
everything is work=
ing enough for the Mailstation to not complain, aside
from the missing text=
 in places.

Yesterday, I changed the =
emulator back to return low battery status, so
that I could get that "The b=
attery power is running low, the system will
power off automatically." erro=
r.  I figured using this for debugging
would be best because it happens dur=
ing the startup, before lots of
other junk clutters my debug log.  Anyhow, =
I created a ram dump right
after the "low battery" message box appeared.  T=
urns out, it's really
getting the text string it needs to print, because it=
's in two different
memory locations, which I've traced back to the code wr=
iting them there.
All I can figure for the moment is that maybe some math e=
rror is
happening when it's calculating the width/height of the text?  I'll=
 have
to decypher that function maybe and step through all of it, I dunno. =

Such a pain.

I did have a thought as I was typing this, that maybe the Ma=
ilstation
was reading the values of the LCD and ORing the text onto what's =
already
there.  But I'm not seeing any LCD read notices, not to mention I a=
lso
remember that it uses an LCD buffer in ram, which is where it likely
wo=
uld do such comparisons anyway.

Breakpoints are a good id=
ea, and I plan to add something like that in. 
But having a full log of eve=
rything has actually been infintely helpful
in tracing down problems, parti=
cularly with how buggy this Z80 emulation
library was when I first got it. =
 =A0It was returning the opposite of
certain CPU flags, doing push/pop wron=
g (SP was handled incorrectly), on
top of several normal opcodes having emu=
lation problems, etc.  It took a
while to fix all of that, and being able t=
o search for every instance of
a particular opcode executing after I suspec=
ted a problem with it was
useful in order to see the results.

To the libz8=
0 author's credit though, he said this was a rewrite of a
previous Windows-=
only version, and I guess he just never had reason to
thoroughly put it thr=
ough its paces like the previous one.  I wouldn't
still be using it if I di=
dn't think it was well-written, bugs aside.  He
uses a regex solution to ge=
nerate the opcode functions before compiling,
which lets you modify multipl=
e similar opcodes in one swoop.  Otherwise
you'd be changing hundreds by ha=
nd.

I'm not sure if speed will ever be an issue once I get rid of a lot of=

debugging stuff, but I've been pondering ways I might write my own from
sc=
ratch if the need arises.  I don't think it'll be that hard, actually.
Just=
 time-consuming.

both are set, time16 interrupt doesn't seem to ever occur.<BR><BR>Well, bac=
k then, I naturally assumed that changing 0x2F was affecting the time16 int=
erval.  But now, after learning of these programmable square waves, maybe 0=
x2F is changing the speed of the keyboard interrupt, not the time16 one.  I=
t would make sense if so.  Let me clarify:<BR><BR>Now remember, kbdtest was=
 incrementing in the keyboard interrupt, and kbdmax was saving this value i=
n the time16 interrupt.  Original assumption was 0x2F was slowing time16, h=
ence more opportunity for kbdtest to reach a higher value before time16 hit=
 and saved the value.  Well, what if you turn that around, and assume that =
it's affecting the keyboard interrupt instead of time16, making it happen F=
ASTER, thereby causing kbdtest to count faster, which is then recorded to k=
bdmax at what is likely still the normal 1 second interval of time16.<BR><B=
R>If so, that would mean:<BR> - Setting bits 4,6 makes keyboard interrupt h=
appen 128hz<BR> - Setting bits 5,6 makes keyboard interrupt happen at 256hz=
<BR> - Setting bits 4,5,6 makes keyboard interrupt happen at 512hz<BR> <BR>=
These values correspond to what many RTC square waves are capable of emitti=
ng (along with the 64hz I've assumed Mailstation normally runs the keyboard=
 at).  I looked at several RTC chips, and many had this programmability, bu=
t I couldn't ever find one with similar registers as what the Mailstation's=
 uses.  Particularly, they store the two BCD values for secs/mins/hours/etc=
 in a single byte at a particular I/O port, where as the Mailstation seems =
to store each individual BCD digit in two separate ports, based on what's b=
een documented so far.<BR><BR>Anyway, I guess the only way to prove any of =
this is true would be for me to display the value of time16 on the screen c=
onstantly, while changing 0x2F.  If 0x2F is in fact affecting the speed of =
the keyboard interrupt, then printing time16 on the screen constantly would=
 still show its value updating in 1 second increments no matter what.  If m=
y new assumption is wrong, meaning it's affecting time16 instead like I ori=
ginally assumed, then the counter on the screen would happen slower.  I'll =
try this sooner or later to see how it goes.  <BR><BR>Either way, I just wa=
nted to point out why I think normally the keyboard interrupt happens at 64=
hz instead of 60, but I'm still curious of your reasoning in case I'm still=
 missing something.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>> <BR>> > happen automatica=
lly, intertwined with port 3's interrupt mask <BR>> > to know whether=
 they should be triggered (and handle when an<BR>> > interrupt gets "=
reset" during the interrupt routine).  <BR>> <BR>> It's not clear to =
me if the P3-out is a "mask", or if it is just<BR>> used to reset the co=
rresponding bit of the register that feeds<BR>> P3-in (where P3 in bits =
are set by the various int inputs).<BR><BR>I think I may have tested this b=
efore, but I don't remember.  Either way, all a person needs to do is hook =
the ISR, and make a value increment in, say, the keyboard interrupt.  Then =
change the interrupt mask to disable keyboard interrupts.  If the value sto=
ps counting, then you know the mask is in fact disabling that interrupt.  W=
henever I get around to writing the code again to check the time16 rate whe=
n changing 0x2F, I'll check this too.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>> <BR>> <=
kluge><BR>> You could just disable the keyscan, and replace it with c=
ode<BR>> that reads an unused port, and calls the put_key_in_buffer<BR>&=
gt; routine with that value.  The emulation for that new port<BR>> could=
 just feed the keycodes for any keys pressed on pc kbd.<BR>> I don't rem=
ember for sure what is stored in that keybuffer, <BR>> though.  It might=
 be the row/col data, along with up/down/shift<BR>> info.<BR>> That w=
ould make it a bit harder, possibly even worse than actually <BR>> scann=
ing an emulated keyboard.  Or maybe skip the keybuffer,<BR>> and just fe=
ed keyevents into the event queue?  Pretty sure<BR>> those are ascii cod=
es.<BR>> (I'm just thinkin' out loud, not sure any of this is a good ide=
a.)<BR>> </kluge><BR><BR>It's funny you even mention that, because=
 honestly that was my first thought: to just dump keys straight into the bu=
ffer.  But this would only work for emulating the Mailstation OS, and I eve=
ntually want all of my custom code to work with it as closely to the real h=
ardware as possible.  So I did end up creating a translation table, which w=
asn't as bad as I thought, actually.  I used an array of 10 rows/8 columns,=
 which stores the PC scancode for each associated key of the Mailstation ke=
y matrix.  I have to scan through the array's rows and columns every time a=
 key is pressed/released to match it with a scancode in the array (so 80 it=
erations, tops).  But once it's found, I can then easily take the row/colum=
n values from the loop to update the actual bitwise matrix array (which is =
just 10 bytes representing the rows, since each column is an individal bit)=
, which is what I use to then actually emulate the output of port 1 (based =
on the input of port 1, 2.0, and 2.1).<BR><BR>Not every MS key is emulated =
yet, and some have been put elsewhere ("Home" is the Home key, though "Back=
" is the End key).  I'm going to emulate "Function" as the Control key even=
tually too, but for now control combos are how I send special commands to m=
y emulator, so I'll have to change that.<BR><BR><BR>> <BR>> I think t=
he only one that is important at this point is the <BR>> 60 Hz keyscan-e=
tc.  The rtc might be important as far as <BR>> waking up the cpu at the=
 set mail-download time, and for the <BR>> date and time to be set right=
 when you power up, but as far as emulating, prolly not too important.<BR><=
BR>As I mentioned earlier, I was looking into a lot of different RTC chips,=
 and most of them did have an alarm feature.  So that might be tied to that=
 interrupt strictly to wake it up to check for mail, as you mentioned.  Mak=
es a lot of sense.<BR><BR><BR>> <BR>> > So I'm left to assume that=
<BR>> > even when v2.53's configuration is set (once I get more keybo=

.<BR>> <BR>> When you get the timers working right, I bet it won't ge=
t stuck!<BR><BR>Well that's the thing, I do have timers working.  <BR><BR>B=
ut, now that the keyboard is emulated, at a cold boot I can enter configura=
tion info (even though I can't see it as I type it, unless I type so much t=
hat it scrolls off to the right; but I can see password asterisks fine).  I=
 save, and get to the user selection screen:<BR><BR><IMG src=3D"http://www.=
fybertech.net/mailstation/img/msemu_userselect.png"><BR><BR>and then to the=
 main menu:<BR><BR><IMG src=3D"http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/img/mse=
mu_mainmenu.png"><BR><BR><BR><BR>I can even use most of the items in the me=
nu without issue (aside from some missing text at times, and the create new=
 mail app crashing).  This is on v2.53 firmware btw.  <BR><BR>But, when I s=
oft-reset after configuring it, my original assumption was correct: v2.53 s=
ticks at the splash screen, just like v3.03 did with the proper dataflash c=
onfiguration already there.  I even tried changing the emulator to always f=
ire keyboard/time16 interrupts regardless of the interrupt mask, and it mak=
es no difference.<BR><BR>I discovered something shortly ago, however.  I wa=
s originally assuming that the Mailstation was changing the interrupt mask =
from 0x22 to 0x39.  But I added in a feature to the emulator to dump ram wi=
th a keypress.  So, I dump ram while the interrupt mask is still 0x22, and =
then again when the mask changes to 0x39.  Turns out, it's not changing the=
 mask.  It's changing EVERYTHING to 0x39.  Ram page 1 is totally full of it=
, and page 0 is almost entirely, aside from values which I assume are getti=
ng set during the message queue loop and such when the interrupt hits.<BR><=
BR>And you know what?  I bet I just figured out what it is, because there's=
 a few 0x39s even in my first ram dump.  Right before they start, there's "=
Jan ".  I bet it's reading the RTC and I'm returning invalid value(s)!<BR><=
BR>YEP!  I just now tried it, returning 0x01 for ports 0x10 through 0x1C, a=
nd now it warm boots just fine!  Even the create new mail app works now (si=
nce it was prolly reading the date/time to know what to put in the email).<=
BR><BR>All unhandled IO ports are actually just handled like RAM: stored in=
 and returned with an array, which I zero out at startup.  So it was return=
ing 0 for all RTC values originally, which obviously was breaking something=
.  I think I'm actually going to tie the Mailstation RTC to my PC's clock s=
o that it's always correct, once I figure out how to represent all the valu=
es (and converted to BCD).<BR><BR>So now, aside from things like the modem,=
 printer port, etc, it seems everything is working enough for the Mailstati=
on to not complain, aside from the missing text in places.<BR><BR><BR>> =
Maybe a different switch to stop at certain addresses.  Then <BR>> you c=
an box in the code where the text is supposed to be copied,<BR>> and eve=
n dump the addresses involved (third switch).<BR><BR>Yesterday, I changed t=
he emulator back to return low battery status, so that I could get that "Th=
e battery power is running low, the system will power off automatically." e=
rror.  I figured using this for debugging would be best because it happens =
during the startup, before lots of other junk clutters my debug log.  Anyho=
w, I created a ram dump right after the "low battery" message box appeared.=
  Turns out, it's really getting the text string it needs to print, because=
 it's in two different memory locations, which I've traced back to the code=
 writing them there.  All I can figure for the moment is that maybe some ma=
th error is happening when it's calculating the width/height of the text?  =
I'll have to decypher that function maybe and step through all of it, I dun=
no.  Such a pain.<BR><BR>I did have a thought as I was typing this, that ma=
ybe the Mailstation was reading the values of the LCD and ORing the text on=
to what's already there.  But I'm not seeing any LCD read notices, not to m=
ention I also remember that it uses an LCD buffer in ram, which is where it=
 likely would do such comparisons anyway.<BR><BR><BR>> <BR>> > Any=
way, I guess that's all I got for now.  I just really want <BR>> > to=
 fix that text rendering problem!<BR>> <BR>> You need to set some bre=
akpoints, or at least "flagpoints".<BR>> I would prolly just compile som=

 a config file.<BR>> <BR>> The idea being to whittle down your log to=
 a comprehensible<BR>> size.  So, you set some addresses that you are in=

 <BR>> addresses on your "watch list", in the order it gets to them.<BR>=
> <BR><BR>Breakpoints are a good idea, and I plan to add something like =
that in.  But having a full log of everything has actually been infintely h=
elpful in tracing down problems, particularly with how buggy this Z80 emula=
tion library was when I first got it.  =A0It was returning the opposite of =
certain CPU flags, doing push/pop wrong (SP was handled incorrectly), on to=
p of several normal opcodes having emulation problems, etc.  It took a whil=
e to fix all of that, and being able to search for every instance of a part=
icular opcode executing after I suspected a problem with it was useful in o=
rder to see the results.<BR><BR>To the libz80 author's credit though, he sa=
id this was a rewrite of a previous Windows-only version, and I guess he ju=
st never had reason to thoroughly put it through its paces like the previou=
s one.  I wouldn't still be using it if I didn't think it was well-written,=
 bugs aside.  He uses a regex solution to generate the opcode functions bef=
ore compiling, which lets you modify multiple similar opcodes in one swoop.=
  Otherwise you'd be changing hundreds by hand.<BR><BR>I'm not sure if spee=
d will ever be an issue once I get rid of a lot of debugging stuff, but I'v=

  I don't think it'll be that hard, actually.  Just time-consuming.<BR><BR>=

Shew it's late, but I wanted to post a progress report at least.





  =
=A0




As you can see, the text is fine now! =A0And ironically, I still ha=
ve
no idea what the problem was. =A0What I did was actually swap out the
Z8=
0 emulation with another library. =A0Took some reintegrating to make
it wor=
k with how this other one was designed to operate, but not too
much work. =
=A0And as soon as I got it to start properly, I immediately
realized it was=
 way faster (probably since I compiled it with its
assembly optimizations e=
nabled). =A0And when I got interrupts working,
and I got to the first warni=
ng dialog about creating a new account, I
realized it was fix. =A0It was sh=
owing text. =A0And then the
configuration window was too. =A0Great! =A0

So=
 that means there's still opcode(s) which are being handled wrong in
libz80=
, despite all the work I did on it to fix it. And not only was it
not showi=
ng text, btw, but in the Extras menu, the arrow keys were
behaving all wron=
g as well. =A0I don't think I ever mentioned that.
=A0 But oh well. =A0I wa=
s so tired of staring at page after page of
disassembled code and debug out=
put trying to find the error that I
decided trying another library was the =
best way to test where the
problem really was.

On an even brighter side, t=
his new library, z80em, emulates CPU timing.
=A0In fact, it does this so we=
ll, combined with a software interrupt
related to this feature which is tri=
ggered after so many CPU cycles
(which you can specify), that I was able to=
 turn this into my main
Mailstation interrupt generator. =A0And with a bit =
more timing code in
place, I now have it emulating a 12mhz Z80, with 1 seco=
nd time16
interrupts, and 64hz keyboard interrupts. =A0The cursor even blin=
ks on
the screen at the same rate as on the real hardware. =A0Awesome!

Aft=
er that, I tied the RTC into my PC's clock, so every time you start
the emu=
lator you get the right time. =A0This means you can't actually
set the RTC =
time via the Mailstation at the moment, though.

Trying to do something wit=
h the modem just freezes it up, as expected.
=A0I want to figure out how be=
tter to emulate that, which I'm sure is
in the datasheet if I still have it=
. =A0Wouldn't it be neat to emulate
a PPP connection with that? =A0But asid=
e from the modem, I haven't had
any problems at all. =A0I've messed with al=
l the apps, saved messages
to my outbox, etc etc. =A0All good.

Anyway, I'v=
e done a ton of work today cleaning up the code. =A0I've
also added in the =
ability to scale the screen 2x, and to even go
full-screen. =A0Seeing the M=
ailstation OS fill my monitor is both odd
and neat!

But yeah, I hope to up=
load a version good enough for you guys to try out
tomorrow sometime. =A0Th=
ere's just still some things I want to add
before I do (like figure out why=
 I have to push the power button twice
to turn it off). =A0For now it'll pr=
olly stay locked at 12mhz, and the
interrupt speeds won't be changeable or =
anything, since there's some
experimenting I want to do on the real hardwar=
e first to see if I can
better understand things. =A0And considering how we=
ll the emulation is
going right now, I can prolly test out some code on my =
PC now before
sending my test apps to the Mailstation. =A0Which is what I w=
rote this
for to begin with!

I think I've finally prettied up a version of the emulator well enough to=
 release.  But until I get a better page for it, here's the directory index=
:

http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/emulator/


The quick start instruc=
tions are: download msemu_v01.zip and codeflash.bin, extract the ZIP, and d=
rop the .BIN into the folder with it.  Then run msemu.exe.  

Make sure to =
look at the readme.txt for info on the keys!  You can switch between 2X siz=
e and even go fullscreen.

In that directory index above, codeflash.bin is =
the same as ms253.bin, which is v2.53 of the Mailstation firmware.  ms303a.=
bin is v3.03a, which is slightly different.  I didn't include any of these =
in the ZIP because it's probably against copyrights for me to even have the=
m on the website.

The emulator looks for a "codeflash.bin" by default to w=
ork, so you can either rename other firmwares to this, or you can specify a=
n alternate filename on the command line (or just drag the .BIN onto the EX=
E to launch with it).  This lets you try out different versions, or even yo=
ur own replacement.

I've included a "dataflash.bin" with some generic sett=
ings, just so that you can go straight to the main menu when you start it. =
 If you like, you can delete that file, and it'll generate a fresh one the =
next time you start it.

Note that the intro screen's text colors should be=
 yellow, and the default LCD color should be green (check the readme on how=
 to change).  If they're not for you, let me know!

I'd appreciate feedback=
, particularly on any problems you might find.  There's obviously a lot sti=
ll not emulated, but apparently there's plenty to make the OS itself run.  =
Just keep in mind that it'll probably freeze up if you try to use the modem=
!

Hmmmmm...  What the heck am I gonna do =

The most recent windows I have is 98, and I have not booted=

Then I wondered if it would run with wine, under Ubuntu.

It does!  =

I get 91ff on my actual unit, and 9254 with my image file.

Colors are ok, and can change with the ctrl keys.  Took me

Calculator works.  Typed a new message=
, saved it in outbox,
and opened it up again.  Even goes into test mode, an=
d passes 
several tests.  The modem test failed, but did not lock it up.
(D=
id not try to send email, though.)

Noticed that it remembered it was in te=
st mode (not sure
if I quit emu, or just "power cycled it).

Could not fini=
sh keyboard test, is there an "@ key", size, or
spell check.  Or "get mail"=
 button?

I would prefer that "back" was mapped to "esc", I closed 
emulato=
r by accident more times than I can count.  Esc just
seems more intuitive f=
or back.  Maybe just make "power" quit
emu???  Or only quit when in "off" m=
ode???

As for why it needs 2 presses, maybe it has something to do
the fac=
t that the "power" does not really go away after the
first press?  There is=
 a flip-flop chip on the ms board that
actually kills power.  

It would be=
 a lot more fun if I could tweak emu code.
For instance, I notice that when=
ever I press a key in
calculator app, emu prints message on text console 
"=
dataflash write".  It would be fun if it said what 
address was written.

I also think it would be fun to compile a Linux version.

I don't know if =
it is emulator, or wine, but the combo
is sucking up over 50% of dual 2.5 G=

OK, top sez emu itself is taking over 40% of one cpu,
and Xor=
g is taking over 35%, and wine about 20%.

Also, I don't know just which pr=

seems like it was when I was trying to switch out of

"full screen" mode.  Took out the X server, and any
program that was runnin=

just listed with "2009" as the start time in process list.

Fir=

I could have restarted X.  Seemed like a=
 good time for a
reboot, though!  (I don't think I have rebooted more that
=
5 times since built, and it is up 24-7).  Took over half
hour to check the =
disk, I don't really want to do a lot
of testing as to just what makes it c=

will avoid the full screen mode, and see if that helps.

As soon as you =

I only have one Mailstat=
ion, the demo unit which runs v3.03a (mail servers can even be set in the c=
onfiguration).  For that version, the hardware gives me a checksum of 0x53d=
4, but the emulator is showing 0x53e5 when I run the same firmware.  

I al=
so noticed that my hardware seems to freeze up after getting to that point,=
 where as the emulator continues on to a battery test.

No idea what's goin=
g on with either of these things yet.  I even tried removing my bounds-limi=
ting for the codeflash (it forces an address wrap at 1MB like I'm assuming =
the real hardware does on pages 64 and up), just in case, and it gave the s=
ame results.

I'd have to dig through the ROM Test code to see if the codef=
lash is the only thing it's testing, or if there's something else being add=
ed into the result somehow.

None of those =
buttons are assigned yet, since I wasn't sure what to assign them to.  I di=
dn't need'em for the testing I was doing at the time, either.  But you shou=
ld be able to assign these to other things now, which I'll get into in a bi=
t.

I'll probably want to assign "Get Mail" soon though, since I've been wo=
rking on trying to emulate the modem chip, and at the moment I have to keep=
 going into the outbox to trigger the modem.

I did consider chan=
ging it to escape a few times, but as I was testing, I found hitting escape=
 right quick to get back out of it was easier for the time being.  I'll cha=
nge exit to right-control + Q or X or something eventually I guess.

The re=
ason "power" doesn't exit is because I want to be able to simulate powering=
 on and off.

Na, it's taking the two presses to finally acknowledge it, which the=
n runs the shutdown function in the firmware, which toggles the bit in port=
 0x28 for that flip-flop.  I'm actually emulating this bit, and "powering o=
ff" when it's changed.

It seems that the Mailstation waits for the state o=
f the power button to change somehow before acknowledging it again as being=
 pressed.  Sometimes, for example, if you hold F12 while the system is boot=
ing, then let it go once you're at the menu, then you only have to press it=
 once to power off.  I tried various ways to replicate this behavior automa=
tically, but I didn't have much luck yet.  I'm thinking it might have somet=
hing to do with the signal bouncing of the real hardware, since the power b=
utton isn't handled for bouncing like the rest of the keyboard keys are in =
the keyboard routine.  

Hitting the button twice is a minor inconvenience =
though so I've worked on other stuff for the time being instead.


Somethin=
g interesting of note is that when you power off and power back on, normall=
y the hardware would retain the RAM contents to my knowledge.  Well when I =
was retaining their contents, the MS would check some ports during startup,=
 before anything was even on the screen (or even before the screen was on?)=
, and then shut itself back down again.  Every time you'd try to power it b=
ack on this would happen.  The only solution for the time being is clearing=
 the ram contents at any power-off until I figure out what the Mailstation =
is doing.

The text you see in the console is jus=
t very basic output.  The "dataflash write" message was actually indicating=
 that the emulator was writing the dataflash contents out to the file, not =
that the Mailstation was currently modifying the contents at that exact mom=
ent (though pretty close to it).  It doesn't write out the file for every i=
ndividual modification, for performance reasons.

However, there are debug =
messages for that, which will not only tell you the current PC when the wri=
te is occuring, but also the dataflash address and value being written.  Sa=
me for sector erases.  The debug messages won't work in the version you're =
using since I removed the ability when cleaning up code before.  But in v0.=
1a, you can put /console and/or /debug on the command line.  The former spi=
ts all IO and other activity to the console, the latter spits it out to a "=
debug.out" file.

Ever since I changed CPU emulation libraries, the debug o=
utput has dramatically reduced, since I'm no longer dumping constant disass=
embly as well.  But the tons of IO port requests are still a mess!  Eventua=
lly I'll let one limit which ports they're interested in.

As it just so happens, v0.1=
a not only includes the source, but will compile under Linux.

As for chang=
ing the Mailstation keys as I mentioned earlier, there's an array which hol=
ds all the mappings, but you'll probably need that "mailstation_keyboard.ht=
ml" file I got somewhere before to know which key is what.  I'm betting you=
 have it though!

I didn't =
have any crashes under Debian when using it with Wine.  Full-screen mode se=
mi-worked, but didn't actually go full screen.  It just kind of replaced mo=
st of the desktop (but stayed crammed underneath the menu bar).  That's abo=
ut what I expected, even though that sucks.

Ironically, it wasn't until I =
compiled a native Linux binary that I had the full-screen mode crash the ap=
plication when switching back and forth several times.  Even full-screen un=
der a native binary still didn't work right, though.

But to be blunt, this=
 is Linux after all, and it's notorious for being problematic at running th=
ings full-screen.  I've had a lot of trouble with other applications runnin=
g that way in the past.  So your advice of "only in a window" seems the bes=
t route, since there's really nothing I can do about it.  Going full-screen=
 is all handled through SDL calls.

That said, console output is faster und=
er Linux than in Windows!  I found that a little surprising.



Anyway, you=
 can grab the newer version here:

http://www.fybertech.net/mailstation/emu=
lator/msemu_v01a.zip

If you have any trouble building it, you can check th=
e build.txt, or give me a holler and I'll try to help.

Try inverting the sense of power-button input bi=

try:

 return (=
byte)0xE0 | ((~power_button & 1) <<  );

(I was trying to enter a tab in pr=
evious post, and all of a
sudden it said "message sent" or something to tha=
t effect.
I think the tab moved the focus from the message box over to
the =
"send" button.)

I have not tried to compile it myself just yet, been looki=
ng
over docs for sdl.

I'm sure fyberoptic knows what I meant, but if (by any stretch)
=
there is anyone else reading this, the "4" got clipped.
It wrapped to next =
line, and when I edited to fit on one line,
I musta deleted it.  

So, this=
 is what I should have typed:
 case 0x09: 
 return (byte)0xE0 | ((~power_bu=
tton & 1) << 4);

I think it is too early for my brain.

If you're=

OK, I got all the pieces installed the other day, and got it =
compiling
and running here, too!  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)

I=
 had to change one line in Makefile to get it to fly with 64 bit cpu:

I ch=
anged
"objcopy -I binary -O elf32-i386  --binary-architecture i386 rawcga.b=
in rawcga.o"

to
"objcopy -I binary -O elf64-x86-64 --binary-architecture i=
386 rawcga.bin rawcga.o"

because the linker refused to link the 32 bit fon=
t file with the 64 bit
emulator object file.  It was pretty easy to figure =
out the "-O elf64-x86-64",
but it took a lot of reading to find out that yo=
u needed to use 
"--binary-architecture i386" for either 32 or 64 bit.  Go =
figger.

Well, that was really good to know!  I didn't even think to c=
heck if it
was in repo.  Turns out libsdl1.2 was already installed, possibl=
y 'coz xmame
required it.  I just checked off the boxes (in synaptic) for t=
he dev files, 
and the libsdl-gfx1.2-dev, and "applied" it.

I made the cha=
nge to cflags you suggested for z80em, and did "make all".  I
got a boatloa=
d of "type mismatch" warnings, but it still works.

I mentioned that the wi=
ndows version was sucking up close to 100% of cpu,
spread across 3 processe=
s (msemu, wine, and I think xorg).  This native
Linux build is still suckin=
g up 100%, but just in the one msemu process!

I don't think it would stop =
anything else from running, it's prolly just
using it 'coz it is available.=
  But it sure is making the cpu hotter than 
normal!!!  It usually reads  b=
elow 90 degrees F, but with cpu at 100% it
was running over 110 F!!!!!  I e=
ven think I could smell the difference,
but that may just have been my imag=
ination.  :-)

So, I looked at source, to see if I could see anything to op=
timize.
The first thing I tried was moving the call to system time, so it o=
nly
happens when one of the time ports is read.  Didn't make a noticable
di=
fference, though.

Next, I looked at the main loop.  Seems that's the sourc=
e of the
infinite appetite for cpu cycles.  The cpu just keeps running that=
 loop,
as fast as it's little pins can carry it.  :-)  :-)

I made an asump=
tion that the main loop was cyling much faster than
necessary, so I added a=
 "sleep(1)" to the loop.  Well, turns out 
sleep's units are "seconds", so =
I guess you know that did not come
out too good.  So I tried sleeps little =
brother, "usleep", which
sleeps microseconds.  Works like a charm!!!

I tri=
ed usleep(1) through usleep(1000), with only barely perceptible
lag noticab=
le with 1000 usec.  I don't know if perhaps it is getting
woke up before th=
e 1000 usec, by some other event/interrupt.  But
I am currently settled in =
on 100 usec, because there is a "diminishing
return" effect on the cpu load=
 reduction.  

With usleep(100), it idles at about 4 or 5 percent, and spik=
es 
higher when mailstation code is actually doing something.  If
I lean on=
 the right-arrow key while in main menu, the ms icon
highlighting cycles re=
peatedly across the screen, and cpu
usage goes to about 10 to 15 percent.

=
If I am understanding how the code works, it seems that the z80
emulation i=
s being called every 16 milliseconds.  Is that right?
(deleted rambling)
At=
 this point, I did a "sleep(30000)" on the wetware processor.

Oh, I think =
I get it, z80_Execute() runs Z80_IPeriod =3D 187500
T states each call.  Th=
at makes more sense now... I was
wondering why it still worked with such la=
rge sleep times!
(Amazing how a little sleep can make things clearer!)   

=
On another front, I did quite a bit of fiddling with the screen
color.  Fir=
st, I "inverted" the colors, making the background
the bright pixels, and t=
ext the darker.  Then I made the
green (now a green background) a very ligh=
t green tint, a
quite passable imitation of the actual LCD.
That took a few=
 minutes.

Then I spent a few more hours tweaking the colors! :-) 

I made =
all 5 of your color modes into various off-white tinted 
backgrounds with b=
lack foreground, 
and added a sixth choice, with bluish
foreground, and sam=
e green tinted background (ala earthlink
version of 120 & 150).

It's reall=
y kind of interesting how fast your eyes normalize
any of the tints to seem=
 "plain white".

Ah okay, never ev=
en thought of that being a possible problem.  I don't have a 64-bit CPU, my=
self.  I figure the simplest solution for future versions, now that I know =
that I converted the font data properly, is to just encode it into a C head=
er file and let it compile with the source.

The reason I included my own f=
ont to begin with is so that it would look the same regardless of platform.=
  And for the record, this is the same font style that I use in my FyOS sof=
tware on the Mailstation.  It's the classic 8x8 font that CGA video cards u=
sed to use.  I'm partial to it both for nostalgia's sake as well as the fac=
t that it's very divisible into most screen sizes.  The Mailstation gets a =
40x16 text display out of it, similar to many old computers.

Yeah I got th=

I never noticed it hindering my machine as=
 I worked so I never even thought to check.  Yet I've had to use usleep in =
daemons before so you'd think I would remember how important some CPU idle =
time in there can be!

The easiest cross-platform fix is:

#ifdef WIN32
		S=
leep(1);
#else
		usleep(1000);
#endif

Windows doesn't have less than 1 mil=
lisecond sleep unless you get into high-definition timers, and that's a bit=
 overkill.  From my momentary tinkering I didn't notice any real difference=
 in performance by having a whole millisecond delay.

I just did some quick math for the number.  The Mailstation OS always ru=
ns at 12mhz, so 12000000 / 64 =3D 187500.  64 being the frequency of the ke=
yboard interrupt I determined before.  When all the specified CPU cycles ar=
e used, the Z80_Interrupt() function is called.  This function automaticall=
y fires the Mailstation keyboard interrupt (if it's enabled) 64 times a sec=
ond.  Also, after 64 counts of this function executing, the Mailstation tim=
e16 interrupt gets fired.

Whenever I get around to implementing support fo=
r various CPU and (presumably) RTC timer speeds, these values will be dynam=
ic rather than hard-coded like they are now.  I'd rather know more about th=
e I/O port functionality for setting these speeds beforehand, but I haven't=
 gotten around to tinkering on the hardware again yet either.

I'd be curious to see your color schemes, if you want to take screencaps=
 or whatever.  I've never even seen the screen to any other model than the =
one I have.


One of the next features I want to implement is a configurati=
on file, where people can just setup the keyboard/colors/etc from there ins=
tead of needing to recompile it.

Oh, yeah, that=

I didn't notice any slu=

added to gnome desktop's to=
olbar, so whenever that drops down, it's
right there.  CPU temps and system=

Looks good!  (So sleep is in ms on win32?  I think it =

1 ms seems fine to me.  It's n=
ot till you get up over 20 ms that it
really
starts to get bad.  Actually, =
right before 16 ms, the delay goes back
to un-noticable.  Seems the emulati=

less than a millisecond, so most of the 1=
6 ms is just waiting.

The delay peaks around usleep(15300) or so, and at 1=
5400, it drops
back to un-noticable.  (This is on dual 2.5 GHz AMD processo=
r).
For a default, 1 ms seems good for just about any cpu speed.
Maybe you =
can make it a runtime config option?

I used the highly scientific procedur=
e of counting "thousands",
from power-on to splash, and I don't quite get t=

thousand two"
with 1-500 us range.  Seems I can get to "t=
hous" at 1000 us, and
"thousan"
at 5000 us.  At 10,000 us I can just about =
get the whole "one thousand
two"
out.  On a real mailstation I get the same=
 as the 500us and lower,

Are we in agreement that the emulator runs at "12 MHz" only b=
ecause
you call it every 16 ms, and it runs Z80_IPeriod =3D 187500 T-states=

every time it is called?

Just for kicks, I just now changed it to call z8=
0_execute every time
thru the main loop, with no usleep,  Now the mailstati=
on code is
running at warp 11!!!  I'm not sure, but I think it is better th=
an
16 x 12MHz =3D 192 MHz!!!  And that would be if it was taking a full
mil=
lisec each call, and I think it is closer to half millisec,
which would mea=
n close to 400 MHz.  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!

Not s=
ure what you mean here???  You mean the PC's cpu, right???
But what RTC????=
?  Oh, you mean setting the mailstation to diff
cpu speeds, right?  And lik=
ewise with mailstation rtc.  You
want it to adjust emulatin speed based on =
port 0d & 2f.

All I know are the 8/10/12 MHz speeds=
.  There might be more.

I was wondering if you ever tested the various int=
errupts, to
figure out if they were INT's or NMI's?

Config file would be gre=

I was thinking that rather than having several canned colors,
it would=
 be easier to tweak if you could adjust the rgb values
of current color.  U=
se ctrl-1, ctrl-2, & ctrl-3 for inc red,
inc green, & inc blue.  Use ctrl-s=

And then save the one you like in the config fi=
le.  Or better,
ctrl 1, 2, 3 for inc, and ctrl q, w, e for dec.

As recently discovered, the Mailstation emulator seems to be returning a di=
fferent checksum value for the firmware than what you get on the real hardw=
are.  I've been digging through the disassembled code, trying to figure out=
 why.

From what I can tell, the firmware does a checksum of each 16K page =
of the codeflash (just adding all the bytes together), then adds it to an o=
verall total as it goes through each page.  I made a simple C util to mimic=
 this, printing out the current and total checksums for each iteration of t=
he loop.  I then also set a trace (via the emulator) on the address in the =
v2.53 firmware where the addition takes place, so that I could see both the=
 current checksum and total checksum in its CPU registers.  Each loop itera=
tion's values match in both the firmware and my util.  Final checksum value=
s also match.

So, unless I've missed something, which is seeming less like=
ly the more I dig into the overall checksum function, then it's looking lik=
e it might not be an emulator issue.  If this is the case, then what could =
possibly be the cause of two different people dumping two different firmwar=
e versions with incorrect checksums?

If anyone has a way to debug this in =
the actual hardware, that'd be even more helpful.  In v2.53, the checksum f=
unction starts in page 2 (if you start at 0), at 0x5e2c.  This all calls on=
 0x2731 in page 0 to do the checksum of each page.  The addition of each pa=
ge checksum into the total happens at 0x5e79 (I was tracing at 0x5e7a after=
 the addition took place).  

Dunno if there's anyone still here who can do=
 hardware debugging, but it's worth a shot!

That sounds like what=

64 pages x 255 max value an 8 bit byt=

value the checksum could be.  Seems like both the=

and emulator are getting higher values!!!  I guess I
need to take=
 a look at that calc.  

From the values both you and I got last week, the

diff between hardware and emulated was 0x0011 & 0x0055,
IIRC.  I find it cu=

so low, and one is exactly 5x the other.

I assume you mean you ran  th=

Can you run it on the mailstation hardware=
?

s with incorrect checksums?

If the code in hardware mailstation matches th=
e code emulator
is running, and gives different results, it seems it has to=
 be
a problem in emulator, or maybe the z80 emulation.

For what it is wort=
h, last few days I have been messing with
trying to run an app on emulator,=
 without much success.

One problem I found is the mailstation apparently o=
nly
uses the low 4 bits of the "device" byte, and when
accessing "apps" fro=
m dataflash, it uses one of the high
4 bits of device as a flag.  I added a=
 printf to emulator,
and the device is sometimes "0x13" when accessing apps=
.
I added "& 0x0f" to the address calc in emulator, but I
still was not abl=
e to run an app.  Without the "& 0x0f"
it the emulation locked up, and with=
 it, it reboots.

I decided I wanted to step thru the code, and since the
"=
docs" for z80em (and I use the term "doc" very loosely 
here) mentioned a b=
uilt in debugger, I set out to try
to enable it.  Unless I am missing somet=
hing here,
there is not really a debugger, rather just a "trace",
and you c=
an set the address you want to start tracing
at.  The trace is not very hel=
pful, unless you can
actually see it, and it flys by faster than the retrac=
e
on my monitor can keep up with.

Have you tried to use it???  Maybe I mis=
sed something?
I did not see any way to single-step.

I imagine I could red=
irect trace to a file, but I did not
do that yet.  I have been wondering if=
 it would be
worth the trouble to add some real debug capability,
or if it =
would be easier to use a different emulator
that already had one.  (MAME/ME=
SS comes to mind, but I
have zero experience with it.)

It's b=
een quite a few years now since I had that stuff set up.
I still have the m=
odded mailstation, but I am sure a wire or
two has come loose.  I would lik=
e to be able to set it
up, but I have a severe lack of empty horizontalness=
 here.
And, prolly the main holdup, I don't use the computer it
ran with an=
ymore.  I had started to do a new version of
the "mailbug" stuff, that ran =
on XP, but I never finished
it.  I would like to resurrect it, and get it r=
unning on
Linux now, just have not had time.

We=
ll see, for each page it's just adding each individual byte together to a 1=
6-bit value.  For example, if every byte was 0xFF, you'd end up with a page=
 total of 4,177,920 (16384 bytes in page * 255).  But since it's 16-bit it =
wraps around several times (you'd get a value of like 49,152 instead).  Tha=
t resulting page value is then added to the overall checksum value each tim=
e through the loop, so the total checksum also wraps many times.  So the ch=
ecksum could be any 16-bit value.

Yeah the test app w=
as a standalone program on the PC, which did a checksum of whatever firmwar=
e file I specified on the command line.  On the Mailstation side, I was let=
ting it do its normal checksum routine from the test menu, but had a trace =
set on a particular address in that function so I could witness each additi=

My assumption was that the code quite possibly didn't match betwee=
n the emulator and hardware.  I especially started thinking this when my st=
andalone utility was giving me the same checksum as the emulator.

I'd be curious to t=

What I did=
 was recompile z80em with debug enabled.  I then added a command-line switc=
h to specify a breakpoint address, which I set into the Z80_Trace variable.=
  When the emulator hits the address, my debug function prints the page/dev=
ice, prints the registers and some stack, dumps the ram to a file, and give=
s me a basic prompt on the console window.  I can hit enter to progress lin=
e by line, or hit C to continue with emulation (until it hits the breakpoin=
t again).  Unfortunately it doesn't display the assembly code instruction w=
hen stopped, which I don't think is even possible using this emulation core=
 (though libz80 could!).  But it was fine for my purposes.  I knew what lin=
es were what based on the disassembled source in my text editor.  I just ne=
eded to see register values and ram.

Still can't peek/poke memory or I/O o=
r anything like that, but it shouldn't be hard to add at this point.  This =
will all be in the next version I release I guess, whenever it gets cleaned=
 up.  I've been poking a bunch of junk in for my own purposes as of late.

=
I may modify the z80em core to be capable of multiple breakpoints too, whic=
h would be useful.  And I can probably do memory and I/O breakpoints in the=
 normal handler functions for those.

Z80em should be fine =
with maybe some minor updates.  I can write in a function to decypher the n=
ext opcode to text myself if I want a more advanced debugger, it'll just ta=
ke a little work.





So, now to what I've done since my last post.  After=
 digging for ages trying to find my laplink/interlink cable again just to s=
end code to the Mailstation (I put things where I'll remember them later, t=
hen forget where I put them), I wrote a Mailstation test program to work ve=
ry similar to the one I wrote on my PC.  It does the checksum of a codeflas=
h page, displays the value of that, along with the current total checksum v=
alue, looping through all 64 pages (with a pause between each one).  I'm st=
ill using a checksum function from the firmware to do this, which is 0x2731=
 in v2.53, and 0x2724 in v3.03a.  No need to rewrite something so small whe=
n it's easy to see exactly what it does in the disassembly.  It's called fr=
om the larger function which calculates the total firmware checksum.  

Any=
how, with this, I was able to match up page checksums displayed on the Mail=
station screen to the ones from my PC equivalent of the program (not in the=
 emulator, mind you).  From a glance, it seemed like the page checksums all=
 matched, until it got to the end.  I then saw the same alternate total che=
cksum value that I get in the maintenance tests on the hardware.

So I incr=
eased the delay between outputs so that I could confirm each individual pag=
e checksum.  It started out good, until it got to page 17.  Instead of 0x7c=
6e which I get on the PC, I got 0x7c5D.  But then, oddly, all the rest of t=
he pages matched up perfectly.  So only page 17 had the problem.  That's th=
e 0x11 byte difference in the overall checksum I was getting between hardwa=
re and emulator.  

This shows that it's apparently not the emulator after =
all, and is something different between the firmware and my dump of it.

Ne=
xt step is to redump just page 17 to my computer and see if transfers wrong=
 again, but that'll take more assembly code, and I'm off to bed for now.  Y=
et I have a feeling I'm going to get the same alternate version of the page=
, in which case I'm going to have to break that page down into pieces to se=
e what's going on.  We'll see.

I got it working.  :-)

I'll post some stuff soon, but helloapp.rom is in =
file area.
Just paste it into your dataflash image with a hex editor,
and t=
weak the "app directory" in page 8.

The app I was having trouble with is a=
 sort of frankenstein
app, with a bunch of tests of various widgets from
th=
e mailstation firmware.

Turns out it was a problem with sdcc linking the w=
rong putchar.
I don't remember doing it, but it probably happened a few mon=
ths ago
when I was switching between various snapshots of sdcc.  I had
comm=
ented out the custom putchar in my makefile!!!  

I have not actually used =
sdcc for anything since feb 2008, but
I joined their mail list back in '07.=
  Since then, there have
been a few problems others were having 
(with the =
z80 port of sdcc), that I remembered having myself.  

One in particular wa=
s that -o just did not work
with the z80 linker.  I had learned to work aro=
und it myself,
and I even looked into fixing it, but never got to the botto=
m of it.

So, though I was not presently using sdcc, when yet another
was l=
earning of this bug the hard way (~ Sept 2009), I took another
look at it. =
 This time I saw what the problem was,
and patched it.

In the process of t=
esting, I was recompiling a mailstation app,
and I guess I got tired of del=
eting the "putchar" from sdcc's
z80 lib in various sdcc snapshot versions. =
 I knew at the time 
that the standard putchar would not work on the mailst=
ation,
but since I was not actually gonna try to run the code (or so I 
tho=
ught!) it did not matter.  When I got done with the 
patch, I forgot to put=
 the putchar back in my lib.

I don't really have a lot of experience with =
c libs, but I
seem to recall that the sdcc manual states that it will use
t=
he version of a lib from the first place it finds it on the
lib search list=
.  IIRC, I had to remove the standard putchar,
but not getchar, to get my c=
ode to link.  Likewise with crt0.

Anyone care to comment on what the stand=
ard behaviour is in this
regard?  And by standard, I guess I mean "what doe=
s gcc do?".

Sounds like you replaced the built in "Z80=

your own, 'coz the built-in one does *not* stop.

Yeah, I made some changes to it myself, but I wonder if it =
might be
better to keep it "as is", and extend it on the msemu side.
One id=
ea I had was to change how you call it, so it only executes
a single inst o=
n every call (and of course mod the interrupt emulation
to compensate).

As=
 far as the number of breakpoints, in my experience, the only
time I ever r=
eally needed more than one was when single stepping
over conditional branch=
es, where you drop a breakpoint for both
possible "next" cases.  And that i=
s only when debugging on hardware,
where you need to modify the code at the=
 "breakpoints".  With an
emulated cpu, you don't need to do this, you can j=
ust execute a 
single instruction, and it will stop whichever way it branch=
ed.

Can't you just dump the=
 whole rom again (with existing code)?

When you say 17, do you mean decima=
l 17, or 0x17?

I recently=

is delete their version of putchar.o from the LIB then include my own versi=
on on the command line when I link a program (along with my custom crt0).  =

t, then it should be easy enough to make a script to take care of deleting =
putchar.o from their LIB automatically.

They don't use the SDCCLIB utility=
 anymore for the system libraries, which threw me off a bit at first till I=
 read the updated manual.  They use the standard binutils "ar" command now.=
  Though to create the index the normal "ranlib" doesn't work, so you have =
to use "asranlib" that comes with SDCC.

Yeah Z80_Debug in =
the z80em header is just a placeholder, you have to create your own functio=

Well, if you only want to execute one instruction at a time=
 without modifying the z80em source, you could enable Z80_Trace, and then i=
t calls your debug function regularly.  That just slows you down in the end=
, though, unless you're only using it during debugging.

I meant decimal 17.

I finally g=
ot around to redumping my codeflash.  As it turns out, I must have just had=
 a bad dump all along.  On this one, my checksum utility now returns the sa=
me value as the emulator which also returns the same value as the hardware.=
  As for what's in page 17 where I was getting the checksum difference, I h=
aven't looked.  I never had any problems out of my previous dump aside from=
 that checksum, so maybe it was either code I was never executing or some g=
raphical data or something.

I just never assumed it was a dump issue, beca=
use usually whenever those happened it threw the whole dump off (and then u=
sually stopped just short of 100% of the total data).  I guess if I ever im=
plement anything involving parallel port transfer (which I started writing =
into FyOS before), I'll definitely be including some kind of checksum on th=
e data packets.

I've jump around between Mailstation and semi-Mailstation-related ideas lat=
ely, and one of them would involve precise timing.  So I was looking at the=
 cycles it takes for the Z80 to execute particular instructions, which even=
tually led me to taking another look at the Mailstation's "delay" function.=
  

In the commented disassembly of page 0 for that function, it shows timi=
ngs of:
  @8MHz, 10634 * 0.125 usec =3D 1.33 msec
  @12MHz 10634 * 0.083 us=
ec =3D 0.886 msec
  
Seems to me that if they ran at around like 10mhz, the=
y would have been much closer to 1ms.  Then I got to wondering if anyone ha=
d actually proven that the Mailstation can run exactly at these 8 and 12mhz=
 speeds, or if these were simply assumptions.  Has anyone physically tested=
 this somehow to be sure that these are the exact mhz?  That would be impor=
tant to know.  I would love to just test this myself (among other things on=
 the Mailstation) but I simply have no fancy equipment beyond a multimeter.=
  Oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, etc, all cost way more than I can afford,=
 unfortunately.

Looking at the group here, it seems some Mailstations use =
a "122AS9Y" crystal.  Mine uses a "122AP98".  12.2mhz?  No way of knowing w=
ithout having the manufacturer's codes.

I was going to test it with softwa=
re, but then I came upon another realization.  What if the clock cycles for=
 this chip aren't the same as the Z80?  Various Z80 microcontroller version=
s I've seen tend to need less clock cycles per instruction.  So this would =
seem to make testing either the CPU speed or instruction timing via softwar=
e impossible without knowing one or the other.

I seem to recall someone th=
inking it was a Rabbit brand chip for the CPU once upon a time.  I've looke=
d at the lowest Z80-compatible chip they still sell, the Rabbit 2000, and w=
hile it has some similar hardware features, it's fairly different in most o=
ther respects.  But it too has the reduced clocks per instruction.  Persona=
lly I have no reason to think it's from Rabbit than from any other company,=
 based on the part number.

This had me remembering that a lot of these Z80=
 microcontrollers are actually Z180/64180 compatibles, and I got to wonderi=
ng if anyone had ever actually tested the Mailstation hardware for this or =
were just basing their Z80 assumption on the disassembly.  So I made a quic=
k test, loading HL with some values, then doing the Z180 "mlt" instruction =
on HL, and printing both values to the screen.  The values were the same, m=
eaning the instruction didn't work.  I even disassembled my binary and it s=
howed for sure that I had used the right opcode.  So I think if there was s=
till any doubt, this seems to prove that Z180 capability doesn't exist as f=
ar as I can figure.

Something else that came to mind is that this chip mig=
ht actually have some flash memory in it for all we know, like all these ot=
her Z80 microcontrollers tend to.  I have a Dallas 8052 microcontroller tha=
t works like this, where the flash can be disabled by pulling a certain pin=
 high or low if you want to use external memory instead.  There could be a =
code/dataflash loader, diagnostics, or even just be totally empty.

Of cour=
se, I'm basing my assumptions on more modern chips, where as this thing is =
10 years old now, and those extra features would have been much more expens=
ive back then.  So who knows what it has in it, short of someone with a mic=
roscope pulling it apart and visually identifying things!

The mailstation resets to 8 MHz iirc.
At 0000:=
1B37 it shifts to 10 MHz.  (I imagine it is 
really 10/12ths of 12.2 MHz + =
or - crystal tolerance
+ or - temperature drift.)

I seem to recall (but I'=
d have to check, and I don't 
have time right now) that my mbug code ran ms=
 at 12 MHz. 

The numbers are just rough estimates. I ran some tests
where =
I counted up the T states a delay would take,
assuming standard z80 timing.=
  I don't recall exactly,
but I probably ran it for 1 or maybe 10 minutes, =
and it
came out that it was running at pretty close to 8 MHz.

This was at =
the time that it was assumed (via Cidco
press releases) that it was a 27 MH=
z z80.

I wrote bit-banged routines for mbug, assuming 8 MHz.

Later, I dis=
covered that during ms init, it shifted gears
to 10 MHz (I suppose I really=
 should say "approximately",
but it is 10 MHz to us non-Vulcans.)  

The wa=
y I found it was single stepping thru the init,
till mbug quit responding, =
right after an "out" to 
port 0x0d.  I wrote a test to set that port in my =
own code, 
and tested the delay time again.

A little experimentation showe=
d you could set it to 12 MHz
(again, "approximately").

From the "datasheet=
" in file area (it's under partfiles,
or something like that, where the res=
t of the datasheets 
are filed):

Port #0D: CPU clock rate.  Resets to 8MHz=
. 
 #f0=3D8MHz 
 #30=3D10MHz
 #00=3D12MHz. 
(might be bits 4 & 6 only. bits=
 0-3 dontcare or somthinelse)

The keyboard matrix data is there, too, alon=
g with LCD.
I forgot to tell you when you asked a week or so ago.
Or I shou=
ld say, I started to reply, but I went to bed 
in middle, and by next day t=
here was new message that
I started to reply to...  I think 3 or 4 unfinish=
ed 
replies to your posts got eaten when sdl locked up
X windows.

I would =
guess that since 0 sets clock to ~12 MHz, that
the undivided clock is ~12 M=
Hz.

I guess it depends on your standard of "proven".

I seem to recall rogblake (on linux-hacker board) sai=

he scoped it.

"Also, I don't know where the 27 MHz comes=
 in, since probing 
 around yielded a clock of about half that. Maybe they =
have a 
 PLL or frequency doubler in the CPU?"

I don't have those myself, but I have found I rarel=
y needed
more than rat-shack meters,and a logic probe.  And the logic
probe=
 is indispensable IMO.

I am ready to jump=
 to conclusion it is 12.2 MHz.

The only one I have handy (already opened u=
p) has
at x101 "122AS99".  x102 is the smaller, and I assume
it is the rtc =
xtal (yes, datasheet in file area sez
the one connected to cpu pins 126 & 1=
27 is rtc) has
no number that I can see.

The modem xtal x601 sez "524AP99"=
 and I recall 52 MHz
was... ok I'll pull up datasheet, the datasheet sez
th=
at the xtal is one of 28.224 MHz, 52.416 MHz, 
or 56.448 MHz, depending on =
chip version.  I can't
find correlation between numbers on chip and datashe=
et,
but, once again, I am ready to jump to conclusion
that the 524 stamped =
on my xtal means 52.4 MHz,
and therefore my modem chip is the 52 MHz, uh
52=
.416 MHz version.

I am also gonna jump to conclusion that the 99 in
the xt=
al numbers means they were made in 1999,
coz that's just the kind of guy I =
am, always jumping 
to conclusions!  That, and I know that they often stamp=

date codes on electronic parts.

> I was going to test it with software, b=
ut then I came upon another realization.  What if the clock cycles for this=
 chip aren't the same as the Z80?  Various Z80 microcontroller versions I'v=

to make testing either the CPU speed or instruction timing via software imp=
ossible without knowing one or the other.


I also have wondered about that=
, but I see no evidence of
it, and plenty of evidence points to normal z80.=


On a related idea, I noticed that the c code uses very few
op-codes.  The=
 page 00 code uses some z80 opcodes, such as
indexed addressing mode, but i=
t is also not as obviously
c compiler generated, as the higher pages all se=
em to be.

I don't believe any higher pages ever use index regs.

So, I won=
der if maybe they used just 8080 opcodes, and the
compiler was really an 80=
80 compiler?

It really does not matter, though!  And I am not gonna 
take =
a lot of my time to check it out.

culation.  But then I started getting 
google hits on other embedded system=
 boards, where
idiots were posting that it WAS a rabbit part.  But the
only=
 research *they* did was to skim linux-hacker board.

It's scary how easy r=
umor turns to fact on the net.

Now, I spent quite a bit of my time looking=
 at the
rabbit parts, and came to conclusion only similarity
was z80 code. =
 And then a year or two later some asshole
posts that he checked, and some =
pins lined up with
something or other on a rabbit part.  So I spent an

that they let just anybody post stuff on the ne=

It really is odd how some people will just throw
guesses out, as if the=

as if that is somehow advancing the effort.

In the older versions of SDCC, the libs were not archives, they ju=
st
had all the .o's in the lib directory.  I really did not want to get
sid=
etracked learning how to remove the putchar from the z80.lib
archive file. =
 So, I just commented mine out in the makefile for 
my library!

> then inc=
lude my own version on the command line when I link a program 

I did take =
the time to learn how to make a library, and I can't find
where the instruc=
tions are now, but (~fall 2007, whatever version of
sdcc might have been cu=
rrent then) the info I found then suggested
just leaving the .o's in your l=
ib's dir, and creating a .lib file 
in same dir, 
where this .lib was just =
a list of the .o filenames that make up your
library.

So, I created a libr=
ary for mailstation apps, with putchar & getchar
(which I only use for debu=
gging), and also a custom crt0 for 
mailstation apps.  Also the header and =
.s wrappers for the firmware
calls.  And a few other functions, like "tribl=
ink", etc.

The main thing different about crt0 for apps is I left the call=

to gsinit out, because the app is not a standalone program, it
is just a s=
ingle "eventhandler" function.  I let that eventhandler
call the gsinit for=
 the app when it receives the "init" event
from the mailstation.  That way =
my globals don't get re-init
for every event, just once when app is "inited=
".

This is similar to a standard program calling gsinit as the
very first =
thing.  Just I don't want to call it every time code runs.

> (along with m=
y custom crt0).  I could add it to their system library and all,

Right, I like to keep mine sep=
arate, too.  

I really think they should remove the putchar, getchar, 
and=
 crt0 from the z80 lib, because they are not 
appropriate for all z80 syste=
ms.  In fact they are only 
appropriate for whatever system the default cod=
e works on.  
(And just what system is it, anyways?????????)

Those 3 funct=
ions belong in a lib specific to a particular
system.  They should separate=
 them out into z80.lib and
generic system_demo.lib.  Then it would be a lot=
 clearer
what parts you needed to customise for your particular hardware.

=
I imagine *everyone* who uses sdcc needs to remove those 
from the system l=
ibrary.

I suppose most people are more familiar with programming
on a PC, =
where the people who create the lib can make
assumption that you are compil=
ing for same type of system 
the compiler is running on, and those function=
s can be
part of the lib that comes with compiler.

I know I am used to tak=
ing that kind of stuff for granted.
I don't think I realized there was even=
 any "startup"
code linked when on PC, but I guess it is standard (with
c a=
t least???)  I suppose I always thought that whatever
it needed to set up, =
it did at the start of "main", before
my code.

After playing with sdcc, I =
took a look at avr-gcc, and 
it has startup code, too!  A different startup=
 for each 
type of AVR chip.

I think that when I=
 get farther up the sdcc learning curve
I will figure out how others are do=
ing this.  I suspect that 
you are supposed to "install" even the snapshots=
, but I still 
don't know exactly how to tell it where.  And more important=
,
where it puts the library.  I don't want it to install in
the default loc=
ation, because I want to have more than one
version available at same time,=
 so I can just change

No, I did=
n't create one, I used the one in Z80Debug.c.

Did you find documentation t=
hat said you need your own?

From the comments in Z80Debug.c:

/*** This fi=
le contains a simple single step debugger which is called     ***/
/*** whe=
n DEBUG is #defined and Z80_Trace is true                         ***/

And=
 it implements the function 

void Z80_Debug(Z80_Regs *R);

that is prototy=
ped in Z80.h.

But I agree 110 percent that you need to create your own, co=
z this
one does not do what the comment says it does!!!

But It DOES disass=
emble the instructions.  It just does not stop,
it keeps going, pouring out=
 the disassembly from the point that you set 
with the trap var.  I tried r=
edirecting to a file, and you don't know
what fun IS until you have tried t=
o open a 1.5 gigabyte text file!

And that was only running a second or so =
past the trap point.  I
knew it would be a large file, but this is ridiculo=
us!

But I did find where my code went haywire and started executing
from t=
he low address of 0000:0008.  There was a "rst 8" right
before that, and I =
checked the address of the function with
the rst 8 in in it, with the .map =
file, and it was putchar.  

That rst 8 looked mighty familiar at that poin=
t, just like 
the "standard" putchar!!!!  It all came back to me soon 
afte=
r that...

Yeah, you could d=

Z80Debug.c that comes wit=

But if you just set the "Z80_IPeriod" to 0, then I think it will

checking for
int after every instruction.) 

The way it is now, you *can't*=

once every millisec.

That is probably good enoug=
h, though.  Particularly for the 
1 ms interrupt.  But when is the 1 sec in=

it is not really an interru=

I've gotta give props to you folks at Rabbit, because it was in fa=
ct me who emailed earlier to ask about it!  Not only did I not expect such =
a quick response via email, but I didn't expect to have the question passed=
 on to someone who was involved in ASIC design there.  So many companies th=
ese days give you unhelpful stock responses to everything, so it's a pleasa=
nt surprise when you find one which actually takes the time to try and help=
.  I certainly appreciated it.

I was going to actually mention here about =
the response I got via email and how you guys had tried to help, but I thin=
k this takes care of that!

Some of the Z80 microcontroll=
ers have a divider as well as multiplier.  Usually just 2x on the latter.  =
I wonder if one of the upper four bits enables that, combined with the divi=
der value?  If you had 12 * 2, then divided by 3, you'd get 8 (going by the=
 rounded-off mhz values listed above, that is).  I mention that since the a=
ssumed 8mhz speed is the only one listed which sets bit 7.  Not that that m=
eans anything at this point, but it's worth pointing out.

Many times divid=
ers are even numbers, so I dunno.  Not that it's hard to do odd, though.  O=
nly takes a couple flip-flops to divide by 3.

In my tinkering before, I fo=
und that setting bits 0-2 made the Mailstation run noticeably slower.  I do=
n't remember what method I used to determine this, nor would you ever reall=
y know if it was the CPU speed causing it, or maybe repeated interrupts (li=
ke a watchdog timer or something) bringing it to a crawl (by running the in=
terrupt routine), or what.  It'd take more research, which I'll get to one =
of these days I guess!

I don't have the logic probe, but it m=

I looked up how to know which chip needed which crystal befo=
re, but danged if I can remember now.

My modem crystal is "524AS97"

It's =
worth pointing out that the chip in my Mailstation is the "SP" variety, whi=
ch means it has speakerphone capability.  Seems kind of a waste, because I'=
m fairly sure there's no microphone.

If that'=
s the case, mine is from 97.  And my CPU crystal would be from 98.  Seems a=
 reasonable-enough conclusion for me!

would seem to make testing either the CPU speed or instruction timing via s=

Well now that it's pretty much certain to be 12.2mh=
z, I think it should be easy now to deduce opcode timing to ensure that it =
uses the traditional speeds.  It's just another one of those "whenever I ge=
t around to it" things!

I've also noticed that some seems to be actual assembly and other=
 code seems much more generated.  Though for curiosity's sake I went and to=
ok a peek at your 8080 assumption, and you may be right.  There's lots if u=

rep for it), but when I actually took a quick look at where some of them we=
re, they didn't appear in functions which started out being "localized".  S=
o they may very well have used an 8080 C compiler.  That, or never turned o=
n Z80 extensions for whatever they used.

This is related to why I wanted t=
o check for sure on Z180 support.  I thought they might have just written t=
he OS with a Z80-based compiler, which would have been why no Z180 opcodes =
were ever found in it.  But apparently that's not the case, unfortunately. =
 I sure would like having those multiplication instructions!

I've done a little digging on a few=

Well you seem to know way more ab=
out the production of that sort of stuff than me so I'll take your word for=
 it.  It would make sense anyway, since as I mentioned before, those things=
 would have been a lot more expensive back then.  It probably would have be=
en cheaper to make a custom chip than to use a stock one with wasted resour=
ces, especially considering the price of flash memory back then.

That said=

Aha, you found out something I didn't even realize.  I didn't =
know it was capable of displaying the instruction in ascii.  I'll have to a=
dd this into my own debug function.

The reason I never noticed this is bec=
ause I never included z80debug.o when building msemu.  Going by the makefil=
e, it's not built into z80.o automatically.  I'm sure if I included this ob=
ject file in mine and commented out my debug function, I'd get the same res=
ult as you.

So the solution is to just dump including z80debug.o and write=
 your own version of the function.  Or wait forever until I get around to r=
eleasing another version, I suppose!

When I was using libz80 and capturing all its disassembly ou=
tput (along with my custom debug stuff too) to a file, I had me some fun ti=
mes as well.  Eventually I changed it to start outputting to a separate fil=
e after hitting a certain keypress (this was before I had breakpoints or an=
ything), which helped somewhat.  But UltraEdit can handle big files relativ=
ely well without keeling over, fortunately.  

I lost my ability to print o=
ut disassembled code when switching to z80em, but now that you brought that=
 capability to my attention, I'll have to see about adding that in.  I don'=
t really need disassembled output at the moment, particularly after getting=
 a CPU library that's not full of bugs, but it could be handy to have later=
.

The Z80_Interrupt function is b=
eing called 64 times a second (when z80em runs out of t-states to execute e=
ach time).  This function triggers the "keyboard" interrupt to the Mailstat=
ion every time, as long as it's enabled in the interrupt mask (P3).  Also i=
nside the Z80_Interrupt function is a counter up to 64, at which point it t=
riggers the 1-second "time16" interrupt (again, if enabled in the interrupt=
 mask).

The "interrupts_active" variable acts as the value that the Mailst=
ation gets when it reads P3.  So at the end of the Z80_Interrupt function, =
it checks if any of these device interrupts are currently active, and if so=
, it causes the emulator to execute an actual cpu interrupt (which runs the=
 Mailstation's handler).  

I assume in the actual hardware that P3 is some=
how also connected (OR'd) to the Mailstation's interrupt pin, so that's wha=
t this simulates.  If any bits of P3 aren't toggled during the interrupt, t=
hen they will just cause an interrupt to happen again next time.  Though it=
 won't happen immediately, as would happen on the hardware, I just realized=
.  But they'll happen at the next execution of Z80_Interrupt.  

I know tha=
t they definitely happen in quick succession on the hardware, because I had=
 it happen in my interrupt hook before when I didn't toggle the bits in P3.=
  The interrupt just kept happening over and over.

Only two of the hardware interrupts are=
 being emulated right now, as mentioned above.  I didn't bother implementin=
g the physical power button and keypress interrupts I found before, since t=
he Mailstation software doesn't use them.  I will at some point though, in =
order to stay hardware-accurate.  I was mostly concerned about getting the =
firmware running properly first and foremost.

In my current version though=
 I've been emulating the modem interrupt, because I actually have emulated =
enough of the modem chip that the Mailstation starts sending ascii characte=
rs to it.  I've managed to get the initialization string to come through so=
 far.  I now need to emulate the chip sending data back, to do an "OK" and =
"CONNECT" and all when appropriate.

I'd just like to get the modem emulate=
d so that eventually my own Mailstation software can communicate with the P=
C over that connection, freeing up the much more useful parallel port for o=
ther capabilities.  Like an SD card reader or something.

Not often=

 so the potential for problems always exists in my case.

I've never done it personally under Lin=
ux, but it does seem somewhat straightforward (permissions aside).  I'm tem=
pted to try it sometime just for curiosity's sake.

Here's you a potentiall=
y helpful resource which I've looked over before:

http://www.faqs.org/docs=
/Linux-mini/IO-Port-Programming.html

I'd say if Linux is your OS of choice=
 these days then it's worth learning.  Lots of things you can do with it ou=
tside of just Mailstation-related, after all.  

I don't know if your origi=

 more complicated.  But the maildump utility I wrote is in C, if you ever w=
ant it.

Possibly the original design was based on an 8080 and they didn't bother to=
 change it. Or their development system only emitted 8080 code.

All the TR=

because that's what Microsoft's system emitted.

Some I/O was done in Z-80 =
because it was hand written.

Go to http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/

Put "pqu" into the Grantee Code fie=
ld.

Search, hit Details on each result, and prepare to possibly shit pants=
.



For those who are impatient and want to know what I found, how does "s=
chematic diagram" sound?

It's detailed documents of two versions of the Ma=
ilstation 250 and one of the Mailstation 350.  Not only are there photos of=
 the hardware, but also photos of the circuit boards, and then the best par=
t, full schematics.  And oh yes they are full.  For example, I now know tha=
t the CPU crystal is 12.288mhz.  And, even better, I know the labels of eve=
ry CPU pin, including the unused ones.

From there, I can see that it can a=
ddress up to 8MB of memory.  I can see that it has TX/RX serial pins.  I ca=
n see that it does indeed have an additional unused device selector.  I can=
 see what is very likely an oscillator out pin, which could possibly be use=
d to determine the frequency currently used by the CPU after going through =
the divider.  I can see that it has a whole 'nother unused 8-bit port.  Man=
y of the pin labels I simply don't know the purpose of at the moment, so wh=
o knows what else is in there.

And for the record, the 350 runs at 34.4mhz=
.

So, why only the 250 and 350?  Good question.  I'll start at the beginni=
ng of my search and go from there in explaining what I learned.

First, I w=
ent in search of the FCC number on the back of my Mailstation: 1EBCHN-27372=
-OT-E.  Turns out, this wasn't a normal FCC ID.  I didn't understand why it=
 was different from what they wanted.  But regardless, I got nothing, so th=
at was a dead-end.  So, by happenstance I dropped it into Google before giv=
ing up, and found some results.  Nothing big, it looked like just some FCC =
update notices of some kind.  Stuff that looks like this:

648-CX-2001     =
        8145386-5
 NOTICE OF CHANGE NOT AFFECTING COMPLIANCE
 HAS BEEN FILE=
D FOR THE FOLLOWING
 REG. NO.: 1EBCHN-27372-OT-E                
 GRANTEE: =
INVENTEC ELECTRONICS (NANJING) CO.,LTD.
 NATURE OF APPLICATION: 
 EQUIPMENT=
 DESCRIPTION: E-MAIL TERMINAL MODEM DEVICE W/FAX WITH CALLER ID
 TRADE NAME=
: CIDCO
 MODEL: FB DET1, DET1A, DET1B, DET2 
 

I noticed the grantee name,=
 "Inventec Electronics."  So, back to the FCC database with that.  Many res=
ults!  But I started going through'em anyway, clicking Details, then one of=
 their external photos, just to see what it was.  Didn't take long, but the=
 next thing I knew I was staring at the picture of a Mailstation, and I cou=
ldn't believe the other files I found in there with it.  Short of a datashe=
et for the CPU, a schematic of the whole thing is the next best thing you c=
ould have.

So, curious of what else Mailstation-related I might find burie=
d away in there (like perhaps the older models), I searched just for grante=
es with that name, which you can do there on the left if you do an advanced=
 search.  I got multiple results for Inventec Electronics.  One of them was=
 listed as "Nanjing" though, which is in that text I pasted above that I fo=
und on Google.  It has the grantee code "PQU".  And sure enough, putting ju=
st that one into the search gives you only the Mailstation results.  Just t=
he three, though, unfortuantely.

Eventually I found that the number on the=
 back of my Mailstation isn't an FCC ID.  It's an FCC Registration Number, =
which is different.  The older Mailstation is classified under "Part 68" eq=
uipment, which apparently means it doesn't need extensive testing, since it=
's just a telephone network device.  However..!  The Mailstation 250 and up=
 use wireless base stations to connect to their phone line.  This means the=
y're using frequency spectrum, which means they require a full-on FCC ID.  =
I probably could have saved myself a few steps if I owned a 250 or 350 and =
had their FCC ID to begin with.  But hey, whatever works.  

In any case, t=
here is one interesting thing of note about the FCC registration number.  T=
he first three characters, 1EB, are this in their database:

1EB|INVENTEC E=
LECTRONICS (MALYASIA)|37 ANSON RD|10400 PENANG||MALYASIA|||08/29/1989|D REG=
INALD TIBBETTS|2151 CAMINO PABLO|MORAGA|CA|94556|

So, as it turns out, Inv=
entec is definitely who developed the Mailstation.  Their name is on all of=
 the schematics as well.  And a Google search shows their name in Cidco pre=
ss releases/financial reports/whatever.

But here's the really interesting =
part: Inventec made a CPU for one of the TI calculators too, apparently.  A=
nyone who knows anything about those graphing calculators know that they us=
ed Z80 CPUs for years.  I found this in a Google search, of a guy asking fo=
r information on a chip:

---------

I'm in search of data for an Inventec =
processor. The chip came from a TI-83+ graphing calculator as bares the tex=
t:

Inventec
6SI837 0A
Japan 0216EAI
PDARD
F0254ZAA

...if it helps, this i=
s a Z80-enabled CISC processor. I've tried googling and came up empty. Any =
data on pinouts, or clocking data would be appreciated.

---------

Notice =
the similarity of the part number!  The Mailstation's is 3SI176 0A.  A Goog=
le search on the 6SI one gives some results, but I found that I get other r=
esults when I put in "6S1837".  Somebody seems to have mistaken an I for a =
1.

So, I emailed Inventec, and I guess we'll see if my email ever gets bey=
ond the webmaster to anywhere that might possibly have information on the M=
ailstation CPU.




p.s.  For anyone interested, here's the somewhat vague =
at times patent application for what I'm almost certain is the Mailstation.=


http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=3DPTO1&Sect2=3DHITOFF&d=
=3DPALL&p=3D1&u=3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=3D1&f=3DG&l=3D50&s1=3D6=
,510,455.PN.&OS=3DPN/6,510,455&RS=3DPN/6,510,455

In case that link doesn't=
 work right, the patent # is 6,510,455.

I almost debated posting anything =
here, but I'm fairly sure none of it is illegal to do so, because it's publ=
icly-accessible information.

Very nice a=
nd thanks!  I have a few 120's, 150's, and 250's
laying about here.  The 25=

for those.  I would certainly like to h=

120 and 150.

Thanks again.  I'm googling around, too.=
  But I suspect that
I am finding nothing more than you've already uncovere=

already.

These devices are in the FCC database because they have radio transceivers.

Somebody will have to co=

I don't see the LCD display pre=

Yes.  One never know=

are a lot of different engines ar=

In=

I'd have to look at the insides ag=

Ah nice, I was wondering about those, and have been doing some poking aroun=
d myself for possible matches.  I dismissed a possible LCD at first, but af=
ter seeing that patent, I think it seems a little too similar to be a coinc=
idence.

I'm thinking BZCLK might be a buzzer?  The 350 has a buzzer connec=
tion for whatever reason.  I don't know how that's used since I've never us=
ed that model before.  But I'm assuming one of the ports would set the freq=
uency coming out of BZCLK.  Could be neat to have.  A clever programmer cou=
ld probably manage music of some kind out of there.

Looks like there's an =
unused interrupt available too.  There's three bits unaccounted for on P3, =
so it's surely one of those.


All I've ever really known about the 350's g=
uts is that it "has a different cpu".  I never looked into it further than =
that since I don't have one.  I just didn't realize how different it was.  =
This thing is 16-bit based on the data lines coming out of it.  It also see=
ms to have two identical sized pieces of flash (which I'm sure 350 owners w=
ho have opened theirs already know), which at first you would think is a go=
od thing, but the sector size seems to be 4KB.  Not quite as easy to work w=
ith at the 256-byte sectors of the old model dataflash.  At least it has mo=
re ram for holding temporary sectors.  And who knows how much the CPU can a=
ddress at one time.  I'd love to know what CPU architecture it's based on, =
for curiosity's sake if nothing else.


One other tidbit I found out is fro=
m a trademark search.  Apparently Cidco also registered "Surfstation".

I noticed that, even though the =
350 schematics includes both the LCD and the keyboard matrix.  So maybe the=
y're not quite as "full" as I originally implied.  But fortunately, we alre=

No prob=

I remembered the old half-working Avigo PDA I had stashed away supposedly h=
aving a Z80 CPU, and it was made my Texas Instruments, so I thought that I'=
d just take a look to see if it too might have ended up with an Inventec CP=
U.

Turns out, the answer is yep!  I took a photo, but then when searching =
for the CPU I found this, which is much better quality than mine:

http://w=
ww.datamath.org/Personal/JPEG_Avigo10.htm#ASIC

It's a 6SI117.

Memory map =
look familiar?

$0000 - $3FFF System ROM region	
$4000 - $7FFF ROM bank acc=
ess region 	
$8000 - $BFFF RAM bank access region 	
$C000 - $FFFF System RA=
M region

It has 1MB of Flash, 128KB of RAM.  240x160 LCD.

Even though it =
has an FCC ID (DGI-PDA100) it doesn't exist in the database.  DGI is anothe=
r ID for Inventec and all, though.  Unfortunately none of their earlier sub=
missions have any files, so even if it's there with another ID, I wouldn't =
know it.

I think if we could find the datasheet or information on ANY of t=
he other Inventec CPUs, it would be useful for the Mailstation too.

Did some Avigo research.  Lookee what I came across:

http://home.eart=
hlink.net/~rdgill/avigo/#I/O%20Ports

Not only does this possibly indicate =
the Mailstation does have a buzzer pin as I previously assumed, but it show=
s the possible ports to use the onboard serial pins.  But most importantly,=
 look at the RTC ports!  They say that version of the CPU uses a TC8521 for=
 the RTC.

http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/32098/TOSHIBA/TC=
8521AM/+22188uOlPGHwwcVhDCvYIV+/datasheet.pdf

A 4-bit Toshiba real-time cl=
ock, which just so happens to have a 1hz and 16hz timer, as well as alarm. =
 We know the Mailstation has a 1hz interrupt, but from my deductions, the o=
ther was 64hz.  Then again, since they built this directly into the CPU, th=
ey could have modified the divider, or more likely based on what we've seen=
, run it through a user-changeable divider (port $2F maybe??).  

I found m=
any other 4-bit RTC chips which did have a 64hz alternate timer, and others=
 with a 1024hz one (much more divideable), so who knows what they actually =
used in the Mailstation version of the CPU.  All I know is that the port ad=
dresses seem to match up perfectly for the one I linked, compared to the ot=
hers I looked at, so that's a good start.  I want to try accessing that bit=
 of ram on pages 2 and 3 of its address space sometime, just to confirm it'=
s there.

Here's a snippet I took from the disassembly before of it setting=
 up the RTC at one point.  Now we have an idea of what it's doing, based on=
 the datasheet:

xor	a
set	2, a
out	(#1d), a
ld	a, #0e	
out	(#1f), a
ld	a, =
#0c	
out	(#1f), a



Avigo aside, this might also potentially be helpful, i=
ndirectly:

http://www.michaelv.org/programs/calcs/ports/

This is for a TI=
-83 calculator.  The interesting parts are the CPU speed and timer ports.  =
Some info might be able to be derived from them, since they might be simila=
r in function, just not directly applicable.

Since the topic of clock speed came up a few days ago, I
have been wonderin=
g about it myself.  I never was very
happy with the idea that the cpu was r=
unning at 8, 10, or
12 MHz, because (for one reason) I did not see any poin=
t 
to it.  IOW, if the cpu can run at 12 MHz, why not run 
it at 12 MHz?

A=
t first I thought the lower speed might be for the sake of 
power-dissipati=
on.  (Assuming it is a CMOS 
cpu, since power dissipation in CMOS is essent=
ially directly 
proportional to clock speed).

But, since cpu goes to sleep=
 when there is nothing to do,
and it would be awake for shorter periods at =
12 MHz,
the power dissipation would be essentially the same at
any of the 3=
 speeds.

Another reason I was uncomfortable with 8/10/12 speeds
is that AF=
AIK it is quite difficult to divide by 1.2
or 1.5, as opposed to dividing b=
y an integer.

But there is one really good reason to run a cpu 
slower:  m=
emory access time!

But if that is the reason, rather than slow the 
whole =
cpu down, it makes A LOT more sense to slow 
just the memory-access cycles =
with wait-states.

So, perhaps port 0x0d is just setting the 
number of wai=
t states?

I have not researched this idea very far, but
perhaps the appare=
nt speeds of "10 & 8 MHz"
are accomplished as "1 or 2 wait-states"?

This s=
eems much more plausible than dividing
the actual clock by non-integer amou=
nt.

It is also possible that they allow setting
different wait-states for =
various devices
(codeflash, dataflash, RAM, LCD, modem).

Yep, that's Zork 1!

So, how is it working?  Basically, I (mostly) c=
ompleted my CP/M BIOS
module, finally emulating a floppy disk with the data=
flash.  This is the
same BIOS code that I was using for the core of FyOS be=
fore, btw, though
just mostly for the console I/O at the time.  Except now =
I'm using the
real CP/M BDOS v2.2 with it, because I thought that would be =
the easiest
way to ensure my BIOS module was working properly. I have no co=
mmand
processor at the moment, but I didn't need one. I just wanted to
dire=
ctly load this one program to see if it worked.  And it does. 
Kinda.

Ther=
e's still limitations.  First is the obvious, with the text display
I'm gen=
erating only supporting 40 x 16 characters.  Zork likely expects
an 80 char=
acter display, and I would bet other CP/M apps would as well. 
Second, my B=
IOS still can't write to "disk".  This was partially due to
the fact that I=
 wasn't even sure my read routine was going to work
properly.  Which it did=
, and only needed one little fix, surpisingly. 
I'm hoping it won't be much=
 effort to do the reverse now for writing. 
Originally I wanted to go to th=
e trouble of some kind of smart system
which would cycle the dataflash sect=
ors to increase their lifetime, but
then I decided a.) it was too much work=
, and b.) if the Mailstation
folks were too lazy to do it, then why should =
I?

For those who may have not followed some of the other work I've done
ar=
ound here in the past, then you should know that this is only possible
due =
to a hardware mod I made to my Mailstation.  I've replicated this
functiona=
lity in my current test build of the emulator.  Basically, I
added in a cir=
cuit to allow the lower 16KB of address space to be
swapped from codeflash =
to RAM.  Normally the first 16KB of codeflash is
permanently in that spot. =
 My toggle lets me put in the second page of
RAM (since the first page is p=
ermanently in the uppermost 16KB of
address space).  This is necessary in o=
rder to run CP/M and its
applications natively.

As for the "disk", I took =
a bit of a clever approach.  My #1 requirement
was that it couldn't disrupt=
 the normal functionality of the
Mailstation, and oppositely, the Mailstati=
on's normal functionality
couldn't disrupt it.  I am in fact still running =
the Mailstation
firmware at power-up, after all.  So, what I did was take a=
dvantage of
all the available app space.  Which is apparently 128KB worth. =
 This
meant that nothing which the Mailstation firmware did should mess up =
my
disk image, and nothing my disk image did should mess up Mailstation
set=
tings.

The virtual disk has 256-byte sectors (to match the dataflash), 16
=
sectors per track, and 32 tracks.  That makes each track 4KB.  I
reserved 4=
 tracks for system use, which is 16KB, which is conveniently
the same size =
as a dataflash page.  This means the system tracks can be
used as a normal =
Mailstation app.  And this is exactly how I used them,
placing a loader app=
 to put the BDOS + BIOS into upper memory, which
then executes the BIOS col=
d boot procedure.

Since I wanted to support any version of BDOS that might=
 be attached to
this BIOS at some point, I decided to handle deblocking int=
ernally. 
This means that as far as CP/M knows, the disk actually uses 32 1=
28-byte
sectors per track.  128 was the common size, and even in the later
=
versions is still the size of things like the DMA and BDOS read routines
us=
e from what I understand.

Regardless of CP/M version, the disk is configur=
ed to use 64 directory
entries, using a 1KB block size.

I wrote a utility =
on the PC to generate this disk as a 128KB file, using
a separate text file=
 to determine what files should be inserted into the
disk (calculating exte=
nts, writing the directory entries, all the crap
necessary for CP/M disks).=
  That disk image file can then just be dumped
into the dataflash.bin that =
my emulator uses.  Since the first 16KB acts
as a standalone Mailstation ap=
p, you can simply launch the OS from the
Mailstation menu like you would an=
y other 3rd-party app.

The fact that you're seeing the game text on the sc=
reen shows that it is
indeed properly reading files from the virtual disk, =
because zork1.com
loads all of that from zork1.dat.  That's part of why I w=
anted to use it
as a test.  The executable was small, and I knew what to ex=
pect from it.

I haven't tried this on the Mailstation hardware yet, mostly=
 due to the
fact that it will erase my loader app.  Before I go writing any=
thing
into my datflash, I'm going to wait until I have both a command
proce=
ssor and a standalone loader utility which I can run from there. 
But I hav=
e no reason to think it wouldn't run, because the disk routine
is the only =
new part.  All the console I/O functions have been run on
the hardware befo=
re.

I'd still like to finish my own original BDOS code, since I think it's=

still technically stealing to use this one even though it's 30 years
old. =
 But then again, it's probably stealing to be using this copy of
Zork too. =
 And my BIOS module is currently using a ripped out version of
the Mailstat=
ion's keyboard routines, as well as the original CGA font
(which I'm sure i=
s copyrighted or something).  Oh well!

Anyhoo, this is turning into a huge=
 post, but my work is finally coming
along into something I can actually sh=
ow results from, so I thought I'd
share what I have so far!

There are versions of the CP/M Z-machine floating around (I found them
in one of the massive repositories a couple of years back) that came
with an Infocom-written customizer front-end.  You might look for CP/M
Zork or Starcross or Planetfall that happen to have a .ASM file
included beyond just the usual .COM and .DAT file.  They mostly let
you select your terminal type (ADM3, VT100, etc), but there might be
something in there for screen size.

Overall, though, Infocom did support 40 column machines (Apple II,
C-64, etc.)  It's up to the Z-machine where to wrap, etc.  The
appearance of the status line depends on matching up the column width,
and there is at least one puzzle clue that I know of that is easy to
spot with an 80-column screen but hard to spot at 40 columns.

Yep.  I've done similar sorts of things with the Z-machine for the
6502.  It's not large and you know how it's going to behave (lots of
disk reads for game text and game data).

In order to get that opening screen, lots of things have to be working
right.  I had a long-standing bug with my port of the 6502 engine to a
new platform - for me, the opening screen was fine, but it got
squirrely with the first line of user input.  At least it was at an
obvious blocking point, so somewhat easy to create test-cases for.

Smashing work.  I can't wait to see a photograph of it running on the
real hardware someday.

Is the "console command processor" (CCP) a separate prog??? 
Or is it pa=

I do recall that the BIOS was suppose=

Perhaps you are closer =

Did you cold boot CP/M, or just preload cp/m & Zork, and
s=

Might it be useful if the bank-switchi=

and you could call routines from the ms firmware?
Then =
you could use ms firmware to access the dataflash, and
even use the built i=
n keyboard code.

I guess you would need to give back the ram at C000 to
ge=
t that to work, but I don't see that as a real problem.
You get a pretty bi=

Most CP/M systems never had full 64K RAM.  M=
ine
did have 64K, but a big chunk was dedicated to screen 
RAM (I forget th=
e actual size, but it did have a graphic
mode, I want to say it used 24k fo=

need to look it up somewhere).

There is a lot more space available in the mailstation's
"file" =
area.  I think there is even one or two "filenames"
available (where filena=
me is just a byte, from 0 to 0x2f.
Using the space that way would let your =
cp/m files coexist
with the other mailstation files.

What if you combined your load=

tracks into a single app?  Or just use=
 2 app pages?  For that
matter, if there is any space left in your system p=

Couple of updates to point out here.  One is obvious, the other maybe
not=
 so much unless you know what you look for!

Let's start with the font.  It=
's now 4x6.  The reason I used an 8x8 font
originally is because it fit per=
fectly into the restraints of the
hardware.  The screen being 320x128 meant=
 you could divide both
dimensions evenly by 8, getting 40x16 characters on =
the screen.  I had
the font data aligned to a 256-byte page in memory, and =
formatted the
data so that each character row could be pulled out by simply=

incrementing the high byte of the memory address.  The low byte was set
to=
 which ASCII character you wanted (since there were 256 characters in
the f=
ont).  No multiplication or anything was necessary to get the
character off=
set into the font data.  And since each byte of LCD data
represented 8 pixe=
ls, it was an easy matter to write an entire row of
character data to the s=
creen at a time, then just increment a couple of
pointers, and repeat 7 mor=
e times.  This made drawing characters pretty
speedy.  What took the most t=
ime is calculating all the junk necessary
to translate X/Y coordinates into=
 the wacky backwards way the
Mailstation LCD hardware works.

Well 40x16 is=
n't really enough for many circumstances, particularly in
width.  Not even =
a CP/M directory listing.  So I did some math on
various sizes.  A 5x7 font=
 would give me a 64x18 display, with a few
pixels left over at the bottom. =
 Not much more vertically, but 24 more
horizontally was good.  So I looked =
around for some fonts on the
internet, and ended up on this page
<http://ra=
sher.dk/rockbox/fonts/misc/> .  It has a bunch of Linux fonts,
but best of =
all, has images available of all the character sets.  There
was a nice 5x7 =
font, but I also noticed the 4x6 one.  More math showed
that a 4x6 font wou=
ld give me 80x21!  That's almost a full CRT display's
worth, just a few shy=
 vertically.  And the more I thought about how I
would implement a font whi=
ch wasn't 8 pixels wide, the more I realized
that using one with an even wi=
dth would be easiest.  A 4x6 font means a
single byte of LCD data can hold =
exactly two character columns of row
data.  Imagine the nightmare of trying=
 to calculate your position on the
screen if every character was 5 pixels w=
ide.  Five bits of one character
would be in one byte, then the next charac=
ter would have 3 bits in the
last byte and 2 bits in the next byte, etc.  I=
t hurts my brain to even
think about it!

The other thing I noticed is that=
 most of those fonts, including the 4x6
one I wanted, are public domain.  A=
wesome.

So I formatted the image of the font characters into something I c=
ould
work with and insert into my assembly.  I didn't go with 256 character=
s
this time because I'm honestly not sure if all the IBM ASCII characters
t=
hat were in the CGA font are even present in this one.  If they are,
they'r=
e so small that it's hard to distinguish which are which.  I left
the first=
 32 characters blank as well.  No more smiley face characters! 
I might sti=
ll extend it to 256 later, but CP/M was primarily 7-bit ASCII
anyway.  I on=
ly included the upper 128 of the CGA font before because it
could be used f=
or drawing lines and borders and things.

It took a bit of figuring things =
out and code reworking, but I converted
my putchar object file to work with=
 the new font data/size.  And
conveniently, changes were only made to that =
object file, which means I
can recompile my BIOS to use the 8x8 font again =
as easy as specifying a
different object file when linking.    The new one =
probably isn't as
fast due to extra math involved, but the increased displa=
y size is worth
it in most cases.

Anyway, I'll stop rambling about fonts. =
 It looks small in the emulator
unless I 2X, but I think on the real hardwa=
re it'll be okay.


The other thing you might not have noticed on the scree=
n there is that I
actually loaded Zork via the command processor.  I got a =
directory
listing beforehand too, though there's only three files on the vi=
rtual
disk.

I've had some quirks out of this.  I can launch stuff, but whe=
n the
application exits and the warm boot happens, the CCP never reloads
pr=
operly again.  I haven't been able to figure it out yet, unless it
and/or t=
he BDOS are storing values which are messing it up, or
something's getting =
overwritten when Zork runs.  I dunno yet.  I suppose
I could totally re-rea=
d the BDOS/BIOS too.  Maybe that's even what
you're supposed to do.

Part o=
f the problem might be that I didn't use any of the original tools
used to =
build a CP/M system.  I've manually converted the assembly code
over to wor=
k with AS-Z80, and am linking everything together as best I
can figure it s=
hould work based on CP/M manuals.  I had to increase the
default tiny BDOS =
stack too because my BIOS calls were overflowing it
(since I doubt most BIO=
Ses needed as much bloaty hardware translations
as this one).  I think the =
CCP is normally part of the whole mess that
gets loaded off the system trac=
ks in v2.2, but I was trying to take more
of a CP/M 3 approach.  I'm pullin=
g the .COM off the disk, but just
loading it at an abnormal location (under=
 the BDOS) instead of at 0x100.
I probably should rename it to .SYS just to=
 avoid confusion.

CP/M 3 actually loads its CCP at 0x100, but puts a loade=
r module up
under the BDOS for executing programs (using the memory-residen=
t module
functionality of v3).  The reason I didn't go all-out in supportin=
g the
CP/M 3 BDOS though is because the BIOS would need a bunch more stuff
=
added to it.  Which I'd still like to do eventually and all, but for the
ti=
me being the plan has just been "make it work".  CP/M 2.2 was the
easiest/q=
uickest way to reach that goal.  And I still have some fiddling
to do.


So=
 yeah, a lot of blabbing just to mention a new font and CCP.  But
maybe fol=
ks are interested in the technical junk too.  Either way, Zork
fits on the =
screen fine now!

You know, that'd be pr=
etty handy to have.  One of the things I want to do to all of this is make =
it work on both modified and unmodified Mailstations.  I'll detect if the h=
ardware mod is present, and if not, the CP/M system area will start at 0x40=
00 instead of 0x0000, and apps will load at 0x4100 rather than 0x0100.  Of =
course, this means only apps compiled to run at that starting address will =
work.  But if one has the original source to something, it makes it a lot e=
asier.  Disassembling something and trying to find all the memory accesses =
to the system area is a huge chore.  I've tried!

But yeah, I could compile=
 a separate version of the Z-machine to run using the other start address, =
if I can find what you're talking about.  Maybe for executables that use th=
e higher starting address I can use an .EXE extension, and write a custom c=
ommand processor (or modify this one) which knows to load them at the diffe=
rent location.  That way unmodified .COM programs can launch at the traditi=
onal 0x0100, if one has the hardware for it.

And of course, recompiling wo=
uld also let me do your original point, to specify the display width depend=
ing on which font I want to use.

Well, who knows where this copy of Zork even came from.  It might hav=
e been for a specific machine.  I've found lots of software during my diggi=
ng around which is computer-dependent, despite CP/M being so open-ended.  A=

 output.

I think this copy was probably suited to a 64 character-wide scre=

 I'm up to 80 characters with this 4x6 font.  That should be fine for any C=

It's funn=

Depends on the CP/M=
 version.  From what I understand, the CCP/BDOS/BIOS were one big clump in =
the system tracks before version 3, and all loaded into upper memory by the=
 loader also on the system tracks.  With version 3, the CCP became a .COM f=
ile.  Though v3 also uses a stripped down BDOS and BIOS in the system track=
s, which it uses to then load the full versions off of the data area of the=
 disk.

Even though I'm using v2.2 of the CCP now, I'm loading it off the d=
ata area of the disk rather than being part of the system tracks, though st=
ill placing it into an area below the BDOS.  I originally decided on this m=
ethod because my BIOS was getting a bit pudgy from having to have the font =
data in it, not to mention all the code in general for handling the virtual=
 text display and virtual disk which a normal CP/M system wouldn't have had=
 (I think a normal BIOS was supposed to just be 2KB), and I didn't want to =
waste too much disk space with system tracks.  I started out with 2 tracks =
(8KB), realized that wasn't enough, went to 3, then realized it would just =
make sense to use a full four for 16KB, giving me some growing room.  I thi=
nk I might could cram it in there now though, especially since the new font=
 I'm using takes less space.

That's true.  The t=
hing is though, there are tools used for actually creating/modifying a CP/M=
 system.  Tools which run on the system itself, already running that versio=
n of CP/M you're going to modify.  I obviously didn't have that luxury, so =
I had to get by with modifying the BDOS and CCP assembly files to work with=
 SDCC's AS-Z80 assembler.  I'm linking the BDOS against the BIOS myself, al=
ong with my loader app in front of all of that.  It seems to be fine, surpr=
isingly, aside from the CCP part.  It works at boot, but doesn't work after=
 the warm boot when an app exits, even though the same code is called.  I h=
aven't been able to figure out why yet.

My original test involved lit=
erally dumping the zork.com directly off the dataflash and into memory and =
executing it.  The BDOS and BIOS were already in place in upper memory thou=
gh via the OS loader app, and this file dumping was happening in the BIOS a=
s part of the startup, so it was practically the same as loading it off a d=
isk, even if a bit of a kludge.  It was reading zork1.dat off the disk in a=
ny case.

After I saw that the disk routines were working, I went on to act=
ually loading zork1.com off of the disk using BDOS commands, reading 128 by=
tes at a time until I hit EOF, then executing 0x0100.

Now I'm still doing =
something similar at startup, except with CCP.COM, but loading it into high=
er memory underneath the BDOS.  It's compiled to base at that address too, =
so I ought to name it like CCP.SYS now probably so that it can't be execute=
d from the command line.

I did originally make the CCP.COM load at 0x0100,=
 but it was incapable of launching apps at that location, which is what pro=
mpted me to shift it upwards where it belongs for this version.  CP/M 3's C=
CP loads at 0x0100 though, but loads apps via a resident loader module whic=
h it loads up high using the RSX functions in the v3 BDOS.  The transient p=
ortion of the CCP then gets overwritten by the new app.  I like this approa=
ch, and will probably use it if I ever write my own CCP.  Though if I rewri=
te the BDOS too, I'll just write the app loading capability directly into t=
here via a custom function call.

My hardware mod can actuall=
y switch slot0000 back to codeflash by toggling P28.3 back to 0, but that w=
ould put the original interrupt code and everything back into place.  I cou=
ld still get around it with the interrupt jump trick using the other interr=
upt mode, but as you mentioned, I'd have to waste some ram to do it.  I onl=
y really wanted to have to use this method for people who won't have a hard=
ware mod, since it's such a kludge.

I wrote my own routine though which re=
ads any 256-byte dataflash sector into a buffer.  I probably could have rip=
ped that function out of the Mailstation disassembly too, but I prefer to w=
rite as much of my own code as possible.  I started rewriting the keyboard =
routines before, but debouncing and key repeat were giving me issues, so I =
ended up just going with the borrowed code so that I could move forward at =
the time.  Not to mention, making the keyboard work again was fairly boring=
, to be honest.  They're still separate and compatible object files though,=
 I can just swap them in and out of the BIOS module, so maybe one day I can=
 have all original code in the BIOS.  The font I'm using is public domain n=
ow, too!

Speaking of switching banks though, I've considered it for some o=
f the larger functions (and the font, for example) into one of the other RA=
M pages, and just bank-switch it in when needed during BIOS calls.  CP/M 3 =
supports bank-switching, even, but I don't have a full understanding of how=
 it works yet.  Not that I need v3 though to take advantage of such a thing=
 if I wanted.  But so far RAM hasn't been a problem for the things I've tri=

That's the th=

 but I have no idea how it works.  So I just avoided that whole area where =
it stores emails and things.  

How much do you know about it?  Like, where=
 exactly in dataflash does it start, what format do the files/directory ent=
ries use, etc etc?  Anything you've figured out might be useful for getting=
 more usable space!

Eventually I also want to finish the code which would =
let me have a drive B which works across the parallel port cable to a serve=
r app on the PC side.  That would let a person copy and move files onto the=
ir Mailstation flash disk via the OS.  At least, once I actually implement =
disk writing, that is!

=
I'm actually using a fair amount of the 16KB of system tracks for my OS loa=
der + BDOS + BIOS.  The CCP I compiled is a little less than 2KB though, wh=
ich is smaller than I originally expected one to be, so I might be able to =
fit that into the system tracks too, which would save a bit of space on the=
 data area of the disk.

I've thought of different ways of including a trad=
itional loader app.  One is to include it in the OS loader, where maybe you=
 hold a key when you launch the app in the Mailstation menu and it falls ba=
ck on that mode to let you load things on the parallel port like before.  O=
r maybe putting a key combo you can press any time the OS is loaded.  And t=
hen of course is the other method of just making it a .COM file on the disk=
.  It's one of the next things on the list to do though so I'll figure some=
thing out.

Well, considering that's where I downloaded most of the st=
uff from, I guess that means it's okay!  I dunno.  That's one reason I alwa=
ys like writing as much of my own code as possible, like with the BDOS.  It=

 different on the inside.  And be another member in the ocean of OS clones~=

Some of this is based on guesses, and any of it may

you can select "use fixed width font" over there=

-----------------------------------=

Dataflash files are accessed by a "file number".

(The number of =
question-marks is an indicator of how wild 
a guess is.  Normal educated gu=
esses usually get 3.)

  0F - sent user 0
  10 - sent =

  11 - sent user 2
  12 - sent user 3
  13 - sent user 4
  14 - ??? =
user 0   (not really sure 14 thru 18 used, should test???)
  15 - ??? user =

  16 - ??? user 2
  17 - ??? user 3
  18 - ??? user 4
  19 - unused??? 
 =
 ...
  1D - unused???  (not sure what highest possible file# is, need to te=
st)
  
I am pretty sure they go up to at least 0x1d or 0x1e, but need 
to t=
est to be sure.  There are also file numbers, offset from 
actual file numb=
ers by 0x20 or 0x40 (I forget exactly) that 
are part of the actual file, (=
or part of the directory, 
depending on how you see things).

I can't find =
it written anywhere, and I forget exactly how it 
works, but I seem to reca=
ll thinking the higher numbers may be 
a "thread" thru the actual records, =
in a sorted order.  
IIRC, At least one file also had a second sort order, =
using 
a file number an additional offset higher (+0x80???). 
 
I do believ=
e the higher numbers are just for internal usage, 
and you don't ever "open=
" one of them, you just use the lower 
set of file numbers.
(I could be wro=
ng on that, though!)
 
(I prolly understood this a lot better 2 or 3 years =
ago!!!) 

I have a vague notion that I saw a place where code was 
deleting=
 a user, and copying the files of higher users 
down 1, to close the gap.  =
IIRC, it was copying 4 different
groups, but I never figured out what the 4=
th group was 
(in/out/sent/???).  
But it is possible it was just 3 groups.=


There is more info on files below, in "notes" section.  
There is a part =
of dataflash I called "bookmarks", but it 
might be better called a "direct=
ory".  The bookmark sector 
holds a table of 4 byte dataflash addresses for=
 the possible 
file numbers.  Each file number has 2 entries (iow, 8 bytes)=
, 
I believe the difference is the sort order of that files records.

I am =
really stretching my memory to the limit, but I seem to
think the bookmarks=
 point to a linked list of records with
the file numbers offset as refered =
to earlier.  I believe 
these are sorted, and each node points to a message=
 record, 
in addition to a "next" pointer record.  The message records 
hav=
e the actual file number (less than 0x20 iirc), and each 
message record ho=
lds a single email message.  I want to say 
that there is only one record o=
f pointers for each file, but 
I am not sure.  It is possible that each "no=
de" in sorted 
list is a separate record.  I don't recall if these have 
th=
e same header as the message records. 

I am pretty sure that each message =
in a file has a separate 
record, with a 4 byte header.

Most files (or may=
be I really mean "records" of files)
start with 0xFD if valid, and 0xFC (ii=
rc) if deleted. 
The 2nd byte is file number, 3rd & 4th (word) are the size=
 
of the data that follows this 4 byte header.
   
There are 4 of what I ca=
lled "special files" that use 
completely different file structure, with a =
fixed 
position in df, and a fixed number of records:

  A0 - user accounts=

  A1 - settings data
  A2 - ???
  A3 - ???
  
Some of the lower number fil=
es (0x02 & 0x03????) have 
patches to the file handling code.  This possibl=
y has something 
to do with the sorting?????  There are also patches to han=
dle
the "special" files differently.

I believe you can open/read/write/etc=
 *any* of the dataflash 
files with the same functions (see my "mailstation=
.h" in 
groups file section).  

There is also info in that header regardin=
g structure of the
data portion of the "message" files (inboxes/outboxes/se=
ntboxes).

The mailstation firmware also has another concept of "files",
wi=
th completely different functions used to access them.
the "ramdisk" functi=
ons.  More than 1 of the ram pages is 
dedicated to this ramdisk, I forget =
if it is 2, 3, or maybe 4????

It is entirely possible that file 0x00 & 0x0=
1 in list above
are not accessed by the dataflash access functions.
(ok, I =
just removed these two from list)

  00 - string table???? (maybe ramdisk, =
and no df file 00?????  if so, then likewise for 01.) 
  01 - widget "sets"=
  (one looks like new acct entry screen, one might be sent screen???)

They=
 might really be "ramdisk" type files????  
The more I think, the more like=
ly that seems.  
I do remember thinking that it seemed they purposely 
did =
not use the same filenumbers for both types of 
file, but I see no reason w=
hy you could not have one of 
each for a given number.
It may be that they =
developed on a system with normal disk
files, and then mapped some to dataf=
lash, and others to 
ram/rom-disk??????????????

The ramdisk functions are =
more like normal file access functions,
there is even a "seek" function ava=
ilable.

The ms seems to use these for storing various data
relating to the=
 "widgets", iow the widget value is
the file data (IIRC, this includes text=
 in text
widgets.

I think two files (00 & 01) accessed by what I called 
"=
ramdisk" functions are actually accessing fixed data in 
the  codeflash.  C=
all them "romdisk" maybe???
No, that is not good, there is a function I lab=
eled 
"romdisk" that is something entirely different (perhaps 
to access th=
at huge chunk of codeflash with the 
spellcheck dictionary????????)

------=
--------------------------

My approach to making a file system for cp/m wo=
uld leave all
this to the ms firmware, and just call the read/write functio=
ns.
I have thought of various schemes, including using one of the
"users" i=
nboxes, where each "message" was a file.  One interesting
aspect of that wo=
uld be possibility of just "emailing" a file
to the ms!

Or you could make =
each record in a ms file be a "track" to cp/m.

note 0: Some of thes notes are redundant.  They may have been writ=
ten
        months or years apart, and I don't have time to edit right
    =
    now.  The "note #" has very little to do with the order
        they we=
re written.

 note 1: These are optional customized splash screen & logo im=
age data.  The
         sizes are how many bytes get copied to ram when thi=
s file is used.
         If first two bytes are not "OK", then hardcoded im=
ages in codeflash
         are used.  

         the first 4 words of the s=
plash file are "5083, 4, 319, 127" or
         in hex "#13db, #0004, #013f,=
 #007f".  The rest is bit data???
         The 319 is x dimension, and 127 =
is y, in pixels.
         I don't think you can change the dimensions, coz =
prog expects these
         sizes.  The splash is a full screenful, and the=
 logo is the size of
         the "Mailstation" logo at the top of the main=
 menu (iow, it *is*
         the main menu logo).

  note 2: I called these=
 sectors "bookmarks" for lack of better idea.  
         There are 2 kinds =
of bookmark sector, and there is always just one
         of each kind.  A =
value in the 2nd to last sector specs which of
         5 different pairs o=
f sectors are the current bookmarks.  After
         a bookmark has been er=
ased 10,000 times, the next pair is used.
         After all 5 pairs have b=
een used, it starts over with the first pair.

         The first bookmark =
sector of the pair holds the start addresses for
         each of the "norm=
al" files, and also a use count.

         The second of the pair just hold=
s the address of the next free
         location in dataflash, and a use co=
unt.  

         All the values in the bookmark sectors are 4 bytes long.  =


         The "free" pointer is the 1st 4 bytes of the "free bookmark" sec=
tor,
         and the 2nd 4 bytes are a count of how many times this sector=

         has been erased.

         The "file bookmarks" are offset in tha=
t sector by 8 x the file
         number.  There are two pointers for each =
file, and I think the
         difference may be that they point to 2 diffe=
rent threads thru the
         same file (unsorted, and sorted?????).  The =
last 4 bytes in the
         sector are the erase count.

note 3: What I am=
 calling bookmarks are pointers to the "normal" files
         (and free sp=
ace).  There are five bookmark
         sectors.  A byte in second to last =
sector selects which of the
         five is currently in use.  The first 4=
 bytes
         are the dataflash address of next free dataflash sector.  
=
         The second 4 bytes are a "use count" for this
         particular =
bookmark.  When use count reaches 10,000 the next
         bookmark sector =
is used.  After all 5 bookmarks
         have been used 10,000 times, it st=
art over with the first bookmark.
         The bookmark sector is written w=
henever
         one of the "normal files" is modified, so it would see a l=
ot
         more wear than any other sector.  I don't like
         this me=
chanism, but wear leveling is a tricky problem, and this is better than not=
hing.
         (08:02:xx) might be a bookmark also???  erased along with ot=
her 5.

 note 4: I called this "magic_sector" just because I didn't know wh=
at it was
         for.  Turns out it is a sort of directory for the loaded=
 apps.

 note 6: the first 4 words of the splash file are "5083, 4, 319, 12=
7" or
         in hex "#13db, #0004, #013f, #007f".  The rest is bit data??=
?
         The larger one is full screenful, other is smaller, probably
   =
      the size of the cidco logo?????

 note 7: user adds are written at tw=
o different places, page #07,
         and file #A0.  Why I don't know.

 n=
ote 8: dataflash pg 00 thru 07 values are from 2.22r, looks like
         t=
est pattern.

 note 9: sectors (08:02:00) thru (08:08:FF)  are not writeabl=
e by
         write_dataflash_low (bookmarks & flags)

 note 10: settings f=
ile data, 16 dec bytes at dataflash  (08:34:00)  
          raw address #02=
3400
          There is a 2 byte header, so the data starts at (08:34:02)
 =
         The default setings are:

              '0815', #00  ;; download t=
ime
              #00          ;; 0 =3D am / 1 =3D pm  
              #00  =
        ;; every (0, 4, 8, 12, 24) hours.   (0 =3D 0hr, 1 =3D 4hr, 2 =3D 8h=
r, 3 =3D 12hr,  4 =3D 24hr)
              #01          ;; save messages on =
server  (0 =3D yes / 1 =3D no)
              '8', #00     ;; max size of do=
wnload (k)
              '10', #00    ;; auto powerdown time (minutes)
    =
          #01          ;; call waiting  (0 =3D yes / 1 =3D no)
            =
  #00          ;; spkr vol   (0 =3D low, 1 =3D hi, 2 =3D off)
             =
 #01          ;; ignore dial tone   (0 =3D yes / 1 =3D no)

 note 11: This =
is the largest area in dataflash, and it is where the "normal"
          fi=
les are, but they are not at fixed locations.  
          The the first byt=
e of a file is #FD, and the second byte is
          the file number.  Thir=
d & fourth bytes are file size, not counting
          the 4 byte header.

Yeah, thanks.  I shoulda thought to just put the =

I had

I have been using google chrome for past several days, and I have=

I like it in most regards.  But it seems that it loses the message =

switching
out of html mode (using the rich text option from yahoo grou=

I switched back to firefox for this try.

That's the puzzle!!!  If you give up, I can email you the answer, but I
=
don't want to post it here just yet.  :-)

Nice to see your still out there Govind !!!!

So what is up with Earthlink ????

I wish they would either pick the mailstation service back up
or release all the equipment and software rights !!!!

With the U.S. postal service now cutting back the Saturday delivery and
possibly rural area service, I expect that the Mailstation or something
similiar would now be a very good money maker.

Still haven't figured on how to re-program a Model 350. Hope somebody
can figure it out. I had a few that I wanted to put on Earthlink, and
one that I wanted to replace a 350 with another one, and Earthlink would
not do it for me.

NO new mailstation service or replacing existing units.

I had to use a model 150 unit and set it up as the 350 was.
My Aunt now has her service back.  She can't live with out it !!!!

These units are great for the older generation, or the computer
illiterate.  Simple email, nothing else !!!!!

Thanks,
Wayne

 for her mother.  When she called Earthlink, despite their website saying t=

I guess it just depends on who you get ahold of as to what quality of cus=

n email account, after all.

No, the 250 & 350 both had grey cases (I =

shades of grey, though).  The unit in the picture is

I'm not really sure which models =

Seems like it was the earlier models though.  

Bu=

I'll post the answer later tonight.

Well, when I first saw it, I thought the screen looked odd. =
 Too crisp for a photo or something, you know.  But now that you gave a lit=
tle hint, it makes me think maybe the emulator's screen is photoshopped on,=
 from where you customized the display colors?

Aha, see, I've never used a=
 250 or 350, but I just now Googled what their OS looks like since I know t=
hey have a better screen, and the interface looks much nicer than the older=
 ones.  So that's my guess.  That, and maybe shopped the casing color too!

Not annoying at all to=

Bingo!!!!!

But I think we=

for noticing the "Yahoo!" icon.  Fort=

is no prize to fight over.  :-)

The hardware appears to be =
a "new 150" with blue-lcd, 
but the screen is really from your emulator run=
ning 
2.53yr firmware, but using my latest blue-lcd colors 
that I "eyedrop=
pered up" from the original photo.  
I suppose if I ran the actual 150 firm=
ware, you guys
would still be guessing.  :-)

I thought the plain old "Mail=
station" logo 
would the easiest thing to catch, but maybe I'm more
aware o=
f the differences than "normal" people.  :-)

I also thought the "too perfe=
ct" screen might give it away.

The logo with no 100/150/200/250 after "Mai=
lstation" 
means it is one of the earlier 2.xx firmware versions.
It did no=
t even occur to me that the 150 might not have
had the "Yahoo!" feature.  
=

I just checked a real blue-lcd 150, and it does not have
"Yahoo!".  I dunn=
o about the black-lcd 150's, I think
they were made before Cidco sold to Ea=
rthlink, so they 
might have it.  It's even possible there are 3 different
=
150's, because the box for this blue-lcd unit shows a
black lcd with logo "=
Mailstation 150" on the screen and
front edge of keyboard.  I can't find my=
 black-lcd 150
right now, but I am pretty sure it was a "Mivo 150" rather
t=
han a "Mailstation 150".

The blue-lcd 150 says "Mailstation 150" in the lo=
go, and 
doesn't seem to have the battery indicator.  AFAIK the
blue *case*=
 was only used on the 150's (both black-lcd
and blue-lcd versions).  And th=
e blue *lcd* was only in 
the "new 150" & "new 120".  (I never have figured=
 out the 
difference between 150 & 120, other than case color.)

There is n=
o way the 2.53 firmware (or the fw from any
earlier model) will run on the =
blue-lcd hardware.  

It was kind of glaring to me, but then I thought
most=
 would not know it wouldn't work, and think I had fed
the 2.53 fw into a 15=
0.  To my knowledge the blue lcd units
require the 4.05 fw.

And, of course=

the photo-editing is not perfect.

Sounds like =

I have a bunch with "Yahoo!" that are locked.

I would expect 2.53Y to be susceptible to the

That's a pity. I thought the Yahoo ones were fixable.

Despite the claims by all the Indian tech support people at Earthlink, the =
Mailstation still works if you're replacing a dead mailstation with a new o=
ne using the same account. The arrogant Indians and their supervisors will =
tell you it can't be done. That's because the Cidco email server has been t=
aken down so they can't send the mailstation an message and set it up autom=
atically. But it can be done manually...

Let me clarify... Grandma age 90 =
had a Mailstation DET1 which finally became inoperable...

she had rubbed a=
ll the letters off the keys...and had used it for 10 years talking to her c=
hildren and grandchildren...

We purchased a Mailstation 120 off ebay... di=
d the paperclip holding down the function D and pulling the plug thing...

=
If you google "Is the Mailstation 150 hackable", you'll see the instruction=
 with a paperclip to get into the mailstation setup screens... 

From there=
, you can set everything as long as you know the password
for an existing a=
ccount. Just change the ISPaccount to the one you're replacing. There is no=
thing inside the machine that is hard coded...
Yes it does require an exist=
ing Earthlink account with a fixed DNS.

We now have a new machine for Gran=
dma. She's 90 now and doesn't have to learn how to type with her thumbs...

Hope this helps...

Wow! Thanks for that info.  Mom's is still plugging along so far; she is 92=
 and terminal with end-stage renal disease, so I suspect the MailStation wi=
ll outlast her (although she has been like the "Energizer Bunny" and fooled=
 everyone including her doctors for nine years now!).  But I have wondered,=
 "What will we do" if her machine goes out or if EL pulls the plug altogeth=
er on its existing users.  It's nice to know there are options, doing a hac=
k an a new machine being one.  Another, and I'm not sure if it's still vali=
d since the post was from 2008, but Patrick Forbes on this board had lined =
his mom out with a new, better and cheaper ISP for the service and made the=
 machine work with it.  You can read the appropriate post here:

OK,

I feel really bad asking this, because I'm sure based on the title =
of this thread that it has been answered a thousand times before.  However,=
 I had the fortune of snagging a Mailstation 150 (V4.05D Earthlink model) f=
rom a thrift store for my 90-year-old grandmother to use.  This was great s=
ince I had already tried to get her to use a computer but could not get her=
 beyond clicking the mouse and moving it at the same time.  With a Mailstat=
ion, she can just correspond; simple.

I had the misfortune of calling Eart=
hlink support and talking to one of their snooty Indians (I don't know what=
 his problem was, I'm a paying Earthlink cable customer).  Anyway, I just c=
alled them to ask for an SMTP server that was not requiring authorization (=
since I doubt the Mailstation supports it).  He practically spat at me the =
smtp.mailstation.com server before I could get him to understand I am diali=
ng in to Earthlink dial-up with it.  I have successfully dialed in and been=
 able to retrieve messages from the POP server, but can not manage to send =
any messages (Get a server busy error after already connected, I assume it =
is bad authentication, no port 587).  

I have already done the Fn+D reset,=
 pull plug to get into the new account setup, but don't want to keep doing =
that every time I configure it wrong.  Below are the settings I currently h=
ave, could somebody please tell me what I have set wrong?

Username: Grandm=
a's Name

I'm not sure the mailstation can function with an Earthlink account.

We ha=
d a mailstation.com account since we started with Cidco.... (which they wil=
l no longer open a new account but they don't cut it off as long as we've c=
ontinued paying the bill and not let it lapse). Our smtp server is smtp.mai=
lstation.com. Also the DNS has to be static I think. The port issue is the =
killer also and that's the one thing I don't think you can change.

You mig=
ht try changing isp's as listed in the other post.
Might be your only bet..=

I started a project two weeks ago to help me transfer saved
email files fro=
m Mailstation units into PC's using the USB
ports that are usually availabl=
e.  It connects to the printer
port on the Mailstation unit and uses the st=
andard "print"
button to start the transfer.  (A program does need to be
ru=
nning on the PC to capture the file and save it, but it
uses a virtual COM =
port over the USB so any serial port
capturing program can be used [or easi=
ly written using VB,
for example.])

It's cheap to build so I wouldn't mind=
 making more if anyone
is interested.  Basically, it's a USB-powered module=

(circuit) that has a USB connector and a parallel port
connector and once =
the virtual COM port software is installed
you just snap in the USB cable o=
n one end and the Mailstation
on the other and the PC acts like a printer t=
o it.  Except
that it can save the ASCII text to a file, of course.

Schema=

Hi Jon,

This sounds like a very cool device that would have applications beyond 
the mailstation. I would be interested in learning more about it.  Thanks!

Hehe.  Well, there is that!!=
  It's a simple device, though.
I'm working on some .NET software for the P=
C end to make that
even easier to use and apply (seemless, I hope.)

Well, the parts a=
re the following:

  1)  TI MSP430 Launchpad tool -- I paid $4.30 and that'=
s
      with shipping costs to my door, included in the price.

https://est=
ore.ti.com/MSP-EXP430G2-MSP430-LaunchPad-Value-Line-Development-kit-P2031.a=
spx

  2)  DB25 male connector (had one in a drawer.)
  3)  fragment of vec=
tor board.
  4)  one 3.9k resistor
  5)  eight 10k resistors
  6)  one 47k =
resistor
  7)  one 560pF
  8)  wire, solder, soldering iron, pliers, etc.

=
The TI MSP430 Launchpad board comes with two cpus.  The
MSP430G2231 and the=
 MSP430G2211.  Both are 14 pin devices. It
also comes with a 32kHz crystal,=
 2 sets of male and female
10-pin connectors for my vector board as a daugh=
ter card
above it, and a USB cable.

I could have ordered a 20-pin MSP430 d=
evice and added 6 more
I/O pins to use -- might have been enough to do ever=
ything
with one micro that way.  But I decided that since I still
needed th=
at vector board to mount the DB25 on... that I might
was well just use the =
parts that actually come in the kit. To
get the needed I/O I had to use bot=
h cpus.
    
The daughter board cpu has access to the parallel port and
use=
s port 1 (P1) to read in the 8 data bits when strobed.  It
also has two mor=
e I/O pins plus an NMI input.  I use the NMI
as the /STROBE input and trigg=
er on falling edge.  The other
two I/O pins serve as BUSY and ACK.  To comm=
unicate with the
main board's cpu, the BUSY line is copied down via the
con=
nector to one of pins there.  Also, two of the 8 data bus
pins perform doub=
le-duty:  as data from the parallel port
when BUSY is not active and when B=
USY is active, the two cpus
uses two of the 8 lines as CLOCK and DATA to tr=
ansfer the
byte over (that's about all the spare pins on the main board,
as=
 it uses P2's pins for the 32kHz xtal and two more for TxD
and RxD into the=
 virtual com port into the PC and some for
LEDs and for switches.

There ar=
e many other interesting details and calculations
involved, but that should=
 get the basic idea across.

Software for both cpus is done and working fin=
e and I've been
shipping files across without difficulty.

Basically, this =
takes advantage of the heavy lifting already
done by an EXTREMELY cheap dev=
elopment board put out by TI,
adding software, vector board, a connector, a=
nd a few cheap
passives.  The whole project, from initial decision to start=

until finished and working software and in spare time only,
was a little o=
ver two weeks.  Thought it might be a good idea
on the 13th of May.  Had no=
 exact idea at the time how to do
it; only a rough feasibility check given =
I/O pins available
and a few thoughts about how I might go about it.

Jon,

That is SO cool! Twice now I really could've used that.  My sister an=
d I arranged for a "card party" for mom's 90th and 93rd birthdays and were =
looking for an easy way to get her MailStation address book exported so we =
could e-mail her contacts from a real PC, easily and without her knowledge.=
 The way I overcame it was by printing out her addy list using the printer =
port on her MailStation (hooked up to an old HP4L laser printer I had with =
a DB-25), then scanning the hard copy prints using OCR, but as you can imag=
ine, this two-step process was somewhat slow and it still took some editing=
 & proofing hassle.  Your toy would've been SOOOOO much faster, easier & 10=
0% accurate.

Mom passed away February 21, a week short of that 93rd birthd=
ay, and I now have her MailStation.  Not sure what to do with it. May sell =
it on eBay someday but for now, keeping it for sentimental reasons.

Your p=
roject looks like fun & fairly inexpensive! Keep us posted.

~Jon (that's m=
e also!)

If interested in selling the unit, let me know.  I will be
making more of t=
hese things and may as well find good homes
for the combined devices.

They=
 aren't just for old people, with this.  The Mailstation
is very convenient=
 (AA batteries, light weight, low cost) to
use anytime one is sitting at th=
e doctor's office waiting, or
anywhere it's likely one has time to kill (on=
 rail transport
or a bus, etc) and would like to write with the idea that i=
f
the device is lost or stolen it's not several hundreds of
dollars of loss=
.

The Kindle is great for reading.  But it is useless if you
want to produ=
ce writing content, for example..

Anyway, I'm going to start producing a f=
inished product for
these and collecting up those units people want to disp=
ose of
for whatever reasons.  Probably not to sell, so much, as to
give awa=
y as presents for those I think would get some use
out of it.

I purchased =
some from Office Depot when they were dumping
them at $5 each.  Crazy good =
price.  Too bad that supply is
gone!

I may, at some point, go further and =
design a unit that ties
in via the phone connector and lets it think it is =
dialing
Earthlink so that I can facilitate a two-way transfer between
PC an=
d the unit.  Make it look like a file system on USB so
that files can be dr=
agged and dropped onto (or off of) it.
But that's for another day.

I used =
this project to continue teaching my son more about
electronics, embedded s=
oftware, reading and finding
appropriate documentation and using it well, c=
reating
associated documentation for a final completion, testing and
using =
oscilloscopes and other tools, soldering, etc.  It was
a great experience f=
or him (and for me.)

Hi Jon,
I have two of them that you can have.  I thought they were a good i=

That's very nice of you.  I'd love to =
take advantage of the
offer and I'd gladly pay shipping costs.  Back in 200=

that with someone in Scottsdale and it cost them $10.05, if I

I will find them goo=

another idea to allow transfers both dir=

can be used as a "USB memory stick."  But that will "tak=

a little longer."  :)

Anyway, I'm located near Portland, Oregon.  Let=

you get in terms of sending them by mail.  If it is too much,=

I might just say to keep them.  But hopefully, the post
office up there wo=
n't take an arm and a leg to get them here.

<snip of address info mailed d=

If you are of a mind to call, feel free.  If you=
'd like to
talk for a minute, but would rather I pay, just let me have
your=
 number and preferred times.  Otherwise, let me know the
"damage" your post=

I would use my bank's "bill pay" to send a ban=
k check (should
be very quick to cash -- no delay, as it is drawn from the
=
bank and not from my account) to you, with your address of
course.

Sincere=
 thanks for the possibility!

So, I am pasting in a copy of it here.

Hi,
I am trying to write in an app record on my mailstation.
I am using=
 an ivory DET1 and the instructions(Method C) from the docs that come with =
FyOS.
I got it to work on an emulator using the Demo Mailstation ROM.
I wri=
te in the code on the Hex editor, but when I get back to MailstationOS it d=
oesn't have the app record under extras.
Any ideas?

What address did you put your app at?

Did you also edit the "app di=
rectory" at 0x020000 in the dataflash?

I realize my documentation is rathe=
r sketchy, and I am not
very familiar with documentation for FYOS.....

...=
.OK, I downloaded fyos doc, skimmed thru it, and I have to
say, large hunks=
 of it bear a striking resemblance to my docs.

It seems what fyos calls an=
 "app record" is what I would call
an "app directory" entry.  So, I will as=
sume you have not 
entered the actual app code yet, and are just wanting to=
 see
if you can add an empty selectable item to the "extras" menu.
(by the =
way, if your mailstation has the "yahoo" folder, the
new app will appear th=
ere, and not in extras.)

So, you need to edit page 0x08 of the dataflash, =
which is at
raw address 020000 
(i fergit how many leading zeroes are displ=
ayed in mailstation's 
hex editor.)  you want to make it look like this:

0=
20000  01 00 01 00 00 00 00 00   00 18 00 00 00 00 00 00

I don't see why not=
.  

You might even be able to email a binary image, but I am
not sure it w=
ould make it through the email process undamaged.

What I was doing to get =
code loaded on a stock mailstation
was loading it to the splash screen imag=
e with mailbug.
Then, with mailstations hex editor, I entered a "jump"
to t=
hat image as a very short app (9 bytes).  When executed
from the "extras" o=
r "yahoo" menu, it would then copy itself
to one of the "app" pages.

I onl=
y used that process to load a "bootapp", which acted
as the remote end of m=
ailbug, my remote debugger.

After the bootapp was installed, I would load =
subsequent
apps to ram using mailbug, and then run them.  The technique
of =
having the app copy itself to the app space worked so good
I just kept usin=
g it to copy these ram images to the dataflash,
and never did add (to mailb=
ug) a function to write directly to
dataflash.

If you mean the "TV listings" e=

graphic image.  But I imagine they were sent as=
 mime attachments
of some sort.  I was wondering if you could send executab=

binary code as the body of an email, and then just jump to the

Certainly not any standard email client.=


Usually even attached files are encoded as text, aren't they?

It's proba=
bly a better idea to send intel hex format, and have
a loader on the mailst=
ation decode it to binary.  And then
it could write the binary to a free ap=
p page!

Or load it into ram and execute it.  That might require
the mailst=
ation reboot when done executing, unless you
could find enough ram that is =
unused (or rarely used???).

Hi,
I am trying to write in an app record on my mailstation.
I am using an =
ivory DET1 and the instructions(Method C) from the docs that come with FyOS=
.
I got it to work on an emulator using the Demo Mailstation ROM.
I write i=
n the code on the Hex editor, but when I get back to MailstationOS it doesn=
't have the app record under extras.
Any ideas?

I don't see why not=

You might even be able to email a binary image, but I am
not sure it w=
ould make it through the email process unmolested.

What I was doing to get=
 code loaded on a stock mailstation
was loading it to the splash screen ima=

Then, with mailstations hex editor, I entered a "jump"
to =
that image as a very short app (9 bytes).  When executed
from the "extras" =
or "yahoo" menu, it would then copy itself
to one of the "app" pages.

I on=
ly used that process to load a "bootapp", which acted
as the remote end of =
mailbug, my remote debugger.

After the bootapp was installed, I would load=
 subsequent
apps to ram using mailbug, and then run them.  The technique
of=
 having the app copy itself to the app space worked so good
I just kept usi=
ng it to copy these ram images to the dataflash,
and never did add (to mail=
bug) a function to write directly to
dataflash .

Hello All,

I am a new arrival. I acquired a MailStation 250 at an auction =
for a grand total of $1. It did not include an AC adapter nor a base unit. =
It is a model DET2B with V1.12 firmware in a silvery grey case. I opened it=
 up to find out what was inside and to consider hacking this gizmo.

Since =
I do not have a base unit that communicates by RF with the MailStation itse=
lf, the first thing I did was remove the antenna and its connecting cable s=
ince it was useless. I rather expect to be doing some hardware work inside =
this thing and I felt removing the antenna and its cable from the board jus=
t simplified things a little.

Thanks to the details scattered around in th=
e messages and files produced in past by this group, I have found out how t=
o get into those extra menus which let one "Restore Default Account" and en=
ter the Hex Viewer and Hex Editor. I also stumbled into what to do to cause=
 it to let me bring up the "Please create a new user account" prompt where =
it lets me enter ALL the settings for a user account including the ISP Acco=
unt, ISP Password, Primary DNS, etc., etc.

While I have no wish to use the=
 MailStation for its usual email purpose, I have played with it enough and =
read enough messages here to know that this might be useful info for somebo=
dy else so I thought I should document it here for others. So here is how I=
 go about it.

 1. Be sure the unit has power, either via AC adapter or bat=
teries.

 2. Start with the unit off.

 3. We will begin by removing any ol=
d existing user account settings and setting the unit to the default user a=
ccount. I have read in many places where all one has to do is hold down the=
 "Function" and "D" keys while pressing the reset button but I have found t=
hat often does not work for me. Some experimenting has taught me that this =
slight variation on that procedure makes it work reliably for me. I turn th=
e unit on with the power button and let the unit come up into the main Mail=
Station 250 menu. Then, with it still in that screen, I hold down the "Func=
tion" and "D" keys and press the reset button and continue to hold down the=
 "Function" and "D" keys during a pause of several seconds, followed by a b=
rief "Scanning memory data" progress bar, whereupon the unit presents the "=
Reset System Data" menu. At this point the "Function" and "D" keys may be r=
eleased. The "No Clear" menu item is highlighted. Press the down arrow key =
once to move the highlight to the "Restore Default Account" menu item and t=
hen press the "Enter" key to select it.

 4. The unit prompts with the ques=
tion "Are you sure to clear?" and the answer "Yes" is highlighted. Press th=
e "Enter" key. We end up in the main "MailStation 250" menu. Just below the=
 "MailStation 250" text at the top of the screen, we see that the unit's em=
ail address now consists of the unit's serial number followed by "@mailstat=
ion.com". If one selects "Extras" and then "Settings", we can see that the =
user name has been set to "New Customer". In any case, press the power butt=
on to turn the unit off.

 5. Next we simultaneously hold down the "Functio=
n" key, the "Q" key, and the "A" key and momentarily press the power button=
. We can release all the keys when we then get a prompt that consists only =
of a wide empty rectangle in the middle of the screen.

 6. Type (without t=
he quotes) "qa781206" and press the "Enter" key. We arrive at the "DIAGNOST=
IC MAIN MENU" screen.

 7. Hold down either Shift key while you press the F=
5 key. The F5 key is the rightmost unlabeled button located just below the =
screen. You will arrive at the Hex Viewer screen. The Hex Viewer is not lab=
elled as such. It just appears as a screen full of hexadecimal digits with =
a wide column of alphanumeric and/or graphic characters on the right.

The =
first three pairs of digits at the start of each line is a memory address. =
The first such address appearing on the top line of the screen will be 00 0=
0 00 followed by a colon (:) and then the hexadecimal contents of each of t=
he 16 bytes of memory starting at that address.  When I do this I see all z=
eros for those 16 bytes. In fact, I see all zeros for the hexadecimal conte=
nts all down this page.

At this point you could use the arrow keys, the "P=
g up" key, and the "Pg dn" key to move around in memory to see its contents=
 but we next need to change the contents of one particular memory cell.

 8=
. In order to be able to change any cells we must enable the Hex Viewer to =
enter its Hex Editor mode. That requires entering something of a special pa=
sscode. To do that, type in the following string (without the quotes) "g710=
304x" and then press the "Back" button. As soon as you press the "g" key, a=
 small box will appear to allow you to enter the rest of the string. Do not=
 worry that there is not enough room for the "x" at the end of the string i=
n that box. In fact, you will not even see the "x" on the screen but it is =
still important. When you press the "Back" button, the input box will simpl=
y disappear and things will look the same as they were before you typed in =
that special command.

 9. Type in this string (without the quotes) "g02290=
0" and press the "Enter" key. While typing it in, the input box will again =
appear momentarily to allow you to finish typing the command. When you pres=
s the "Enter" key, the Hex Viewer will begin displaying the data for the me=
mory cells beginning at address 022900. We can confirm this is where we are=
 in memory by reading that the start of the first line reads like this: 02 =
29 00 : 01 00 4e 65 77 20 and so forth. If we look at the panel of alphanum=
eric/graphic characters on the right side of the screen, we see that the fi=
rst line contains the words "New Customer". Also, a few lines after that, w=
e see the default email address consisting of the unit's serial number foll=
owed by "@..." We can also note that the first digit (a zero) f=
ollowing that colon on the first line of the screen is highlighted. Press t=
he right arrow key one time to move the highlight to the very next characte=
r which is a "1".

10. I suspect that this "1" indicates that there is one =
email account set up in the unit but that is just my best guess. In any cas=
e, I find that for me this next step gets me to where I want to go. Press t=
he "S" key. We see that the right part of the screen changes to indicate th=
at we have entered the Hex Editor. It shows us that we could press Ctrl+S t=
o Save & Exit, Back to Exit, Arrow to move the cursor, or 0-9,A-F for input=
. We also see that the highlight is still on that "1". (By the way, althoug=
h it says "Ctrl+S" is used to "Save & Exit", all that is really needed is j=
ust "S".)

11. Press the "0" key (the zero key, not the alphabetic "O" key)=
. Now the two digit number following that colon near the start of the first=
 line reads "00" instead of "01". Next press the "S" key to save this small=
 memory change and return to the Hex Viewer display screen. I believe that =
we have just told the MailStation there are no email accounts currently set=
 up.

12. Press the "Back" button to exit the Hex Viewer and return to the =
"DIAGNOSTIC MAIN MENU" screen.

13. Press the "Q" key to exit this screen. =
A "Test Over" message briefly appears on the screen and then we see a "Scan=
ning memory data" progress bar followed by the the "Reset System Data" menu=
 again. This time, it does not include the "Restore Default Account" menu i=
tem. The "No Clear" menu item is highlighted. Press the "Enter" key. We now=
 see a prompt for "Please create a new user account." with an "OK" response=
 highlighted. Press the "Enter" key. We now see a "User Settings" screen wh=
ere we can input a response to each of the following prompts:

      User N=
ame:
     Dial-Up No:
       Reply-To:
____________________________________=
_________________
 E-Mail Address:
E-Mail Password:
    POP3 Server:
    SM=
TP Server:
    ISP Account:
   ISP Password:
    Primary DNS:

Once we have=
 assigned a value to each prompt, press the F1 key which is now labelled "S=
ave" at the bottom of the screen. The new user account data is saved and we=
 are left in the main "MailStation 250" menu.



For my own personal purpos=
es, I would like to see the MailStation be set up to run just about any typ=
e of operating system or other underlying system that then supports some ve=
rsion of Microsoft Basic. It could be MBasic under CP/M or it could be a Ba=
sic interpreter from one of the TRS-80 computers. I would even consider the=
 very original Microsoft Basic interpreter, the one written for the Altair =
8800. I helped a friend build his Altair 8800 many years ago and we wrote m=
any programs on his system. I would at least want the version intended for =
8K because the 4k version did not really support character strings. So I am=
 pretty easy to satisfy. I have become aware of FyberOptic and his FyOS ope=
rating system but have not had time to totally gage its current state, avai=
lability, and applicability. In any case, I congratulate Jeff, Cyrano, Don,=
 and others who have contributed so much of their time and sweat to uncover=
 the secrets of these neat little computers.

Joe

 V1.12 and some wishes for      repurposing it<br> </fo=
nt> </div> <br>Fantastic job !!!!<br><br>Do you think this might also work =
with the model 350 ?<br>Wayne<br><br><br>> Hello All,<br>><br>> I =
am a new arrival. I acquired a MailStation 250 at an auction for a grand<br=
>> total of $1. It did not include an AC adapter nor a base unit. It is =
a<br>> model DET2B with V1.12 firmware in a silvery grey case. I opened =
it up to<br>> find out what was inside and to consider hacking this gizm=
o.<br>><br>> Since I do not have a base unit that communicates by RF =
with the<br>> MailStation itself, the first thing I did was remove the a=
ntenna and its<br>> connecting cable since it was useless. I rather expe=
ct to be doing some<br>> hardware work inside this thing and I felt remo=
ving the antenna and its<br>> cable from the board just simplified thing=
s a little.<br>><br>> Thanks to the details scattered around in the m=
essages and
 files produced<br>> in past by this group, I have found out=
 how to get into those extra menus<br>> which let one "Restore Default A=
ccount" and enter the Hex Viewer and Hex<br>> Editor. I also stumbled in=
to what to do to cause it to let me bring up the<br>> "Please create a n=
ew user account" prompt where it lets me enter ALL the<br>> settings for=
 a user account including the ISP Account, ISP Password,<br>> Primary DN=
S, etc., etc.<br>><br>> While I have no wish to use the MailStation f=
or its usual email purpose, I<br>> have played with it enough and read e=
nough messages here to know that this<br>> might be useful info for some=
body else so I thought I should document it<br>> here for others. So her=
e is how I go about it.<br>><br>>&nbsp; 1. Be sure the unit has power=
, either via AC adapter or batteries.<br>><br>>&nbsp; 2. Start with t=
he unit off.<br>><br>>&nbsp; 3. We will begin by removing any old exi=
sting
 user account settings and<br>> setting the unit to the default us=
er account. I have read in many places<br>> where all one has to do is h=
old down the "Function" and "D" keys while<br>> pressing the reset butto=
n but I have found that often does not work for<br>> me. Some experiment=
ing has taught me that this slight variation on that<br>> procedure make=
s it work reliably for me. I turn the unit on with the<br>> power button=
 and let the unit come up into the main MailStation 250 menu.<br>> Then,=
 with it still in that screen, I hold down the "Function" and "D"<br>> k=
eys and press the reset button and continue to hold down the "Function"<br>=
> and "D" keys during a pause of several seconds, followed by a brief<br=
>> "Scanning memory data" progress bar, whereupon the unit presents the<=
br>> "Reset System Data" menu. At this point the "Function" and "D" keys=
 may<br>> be released. The "No Clear" menu item is highlighted. Press
 t=
he down<br>> arrow key once to move the highlight to the "Restore Defaul=
t Account"<br>> menu item and then press the "Enter" key to select it.<b=
r>><br>>&nbsp; 4. The unit prompts with the question "Are you sure to=
 clear?" and the<br>> answer "Yes" is highlighted. Press the "Enter" key=
. We end up in the main<br>> "MailStation 250" menu. Just below the "Mai=
lStation 250" text at the top<br>> of the screen, we see that the unit's=
 email address now consists of the<br>> unit's serial number followed by=
 "@...". If one selects<br>> "Extras" and then "Settings", w=
e can see that the user name has been set<br>> to "New Customer". In any=
 case, press the power button to turn the unit<br>> off.<br>><br>>=
&nbsp; 5. Next we simultaneously hold down the "Function" key, the "Q" key,=
 and<br>> the "A" key and momentarily press the power button. We can rel=
ease all<br>> the keys when we then get a prompt that consists
 only of =
a wide empty<br>> rectangle in the middle of the screen.<br>><br>>=
&nbsp; 6. Type (without the quotes) "qa781206" and press the "Enter" key. W=
e<br>> arrive at the "DIAGNOSTIC MAIN MENU" screen.<br>><br>>&nbsp=
; 7. Hold down either Shift key while you press the F5 key. The F5 key is<b=
r>> the rightmost unlabeled button located just below the screen. You wi=
ll<br>> arrive at the Hex Viewer screen. The Hex Viewer is not labelled =
as such.<br>> It just appears as a screen full of hexadecimal digits wit=
h a wide column<br>> of alphanumeric and/or graphic characters on the ri=
ght.<br>><br>> The first three pairs of digits at the start of each l=
ine is a memory<br>> address. The first such address appearing on the to=
p line of the screen<br>> will be 00 00 00 followed by a colon (:) and t=
hen the hexadecimal contents<br>> of each of the 16 bytes of memory star=
ting at that address.&nbsp; When I do<br>> this I see
 all zeros for tho=
se 16 bytes. In fact, I see all zeros for the<br>> hexadecimal contents =
all down this page.<br>><br>> At this point you could use the arrow k=
eys, the "Pg up" key, and the "Pg<br>> dn" key to move around in memory =
to see its contents but we next need to<br>> change the contents of one =
particular memory cell.<br>><br>>&nbsp; 8. In order to be able to cha=
nge any cells we must enable the Hex Viewer<br>> to enter its Hex Editor=
 mode. That requires entering something of a<br>> special passcode. To d=
o that, type in the following string (without the<br>> quotes) "g710304x=
" and then press the "Back" button. As soon as you press<br>> the "g" ke=
y, a small box will appear to allow you to enter the rest of<br>> the st=
ring. Do not worry that there is not enough room for the "x" at the<br>>=
 end of the string in that box. In fact, you will not even see the "x" on<b=
r>> the screen but it is still important. When
 you press the "Back" but=
ton,<br>> the input box will simply disappear and things will look the s=
ame as they<br>> were before you typed in that special command.<br>><=
br>>&nbsp; 9. Type in this string (without the quotes) "g022900" and pre=
ss the<br>> "Enter" key. While typing it in, the input box will again ap=
pear<br>> momentarily to allow you to finish typing the command. When yo=
u press the<br>> "Enter" key, the Hex Viewer will begin displaying the d=
ata for the memory<br>> cells beginning at address 022900. We can confir=
m this is where we are in<br>> memory by reading that the start of the f=
irst line reads like this: 02 29<br>> 00 : 01 00 4e 65 77 20 and so fort=
h. If we look at the panel of<br>> alphanumeric/graphic characters on th=
e right side of the screen, we see<br>> that the first line contains the=
 words "New Customer". Also, a few lines<br>> after that, we see the def=
ault email address consisting of the
 unit's<br>> serial number followed=
 by "@..." We can also note that the<br>> first digit (a zer=
o) following that colon on the first line of the screen<br>> is highligh=
ted. Press the right arrow key one time to move the highlight<br>> to th=
e very next character which is a "1".<br>><br>> 10. I suspect that th=
is "1" indicates that there is one email account set<br>> up in the unit=
 but that is just my best guess. In any case, I find that<br>> for me th=
is next step gets me to where I want to go. Press the "S" key. We<br>> s=

Your guess is as good as mine about the 350 since I have never seen one. I =
do know from reading many of the messages in this group that the 350 does n=
ot use the same type of central processor chip and that means the firmware =
in its ROMs will likely be very different. Does that mean that the data in =
RAM is laid out the same? Well, it could be but I would bet against it. So =
I would expect that these procedures would not work exactly as I have writt=
en them but it is always possible that they might.

Be careful. In my case,=
 I was not too worried about messing up my 250 since I only had a dollar in=
vested in it and the only time I had invested was with reading hundreds of =
messages and a few files located in this group.

Good Luck,
Joe

Hello,

My mother has been using her Mailstation for many years, but she is=
 thinking of getting another device to use, possibly an iPad or a computer.=
 she does not want to change her email address. Is there a way for her to s=
end and receive from her Mailstation account on another device, or is the a=
ccount somehow locked to the mailstation?

Thank you for your time,

Warren=

It is a normal POP3 and SMTP email account. You can log into it using
their webmail from any browser. But you have to know what passwords were
used in setting it up.

There is the ISP account and password, which you will not use if you
already have internet access on the new device (it is for dial-up access).

Then you have the email account and password.  If you already have
internet access, you can use Microsoft Outlook or something else to
connect to the incoming mail server and outgoing mail server.  Or go to
www.Earthlink.com  and use the webmail access tab on the upper right.
Enter the email address ( "user"@...) and then your email
password.  The browser will open up on the email account, and you can send
and receive from it.

What Wayne said.  Each MailStation account has an associated Earthlink webm=
ail account and it is easy to access from anywhere just like any webmail ac=
count.  In fact, I think all the mail really goes there first then is actua=
lly downloaded by the MailStation device which acts as a "mail client" (I'm=
 not too technical so I could be wrong, but it looked that way in mom's, al=
though sometimes stuff would appear one place but not the other or vanish f=
rom webmail once downloaded to the MailStation?)

However, you might point =
out to her the following:

1) If she keeps the account, it will cost her an=
other $10/month or whatever Earthlink is now charging for MailStation e-mai=
l (my mom died just over a year ago), in addition to her cost of an ISP for=
 the new device (even if she foolishly uses Earthlink for that, I don't thi=
nk they'll cooperate on the MailStation account - see #2)

2) Earthlink is =
aggressively trying to let MailStation die out; they will not make any chan=
ges to accounts nor open new ones, and what little and poor "support" is av=
ailable is through CSRs in India or Pakistan

If she indeed changes, why no=
t try to get her the same e-mail name on a nice webmail account or her new =
ISP, if available, e.g., from "MotherName123@..." (or @mymailstatio=
n.com or whatever she is using) to "MotherName123@..." or @yahoo or @=
newISP.  We did this with my mom's when she was no longer able to drive her=
 own MailStation anymore, and it enabled me to access her e-mail and answer=
 it for her FREE (vs. accessing it through EL webmail for $10 per month ext=
ra).  It was easy to use the old MailStation to send one last "change of e-=
mail address" e-mail to all her contacts, and the thing has a printer port =
(LPT1 - Centronics type) to print out her address book.  That would have to=
 manually be input into the new account (and even into the associated Earth=
link webmail account; the addresses are in I guess flash memory on the devi=
ce itself), unless you are smart enough to make a program to convert them f=
rom a print file.  (I actually used an OCR scanner on the printed pages of =
Mom's)

Hope this info helps.  If she's not short on cash, I guess just let=
 her pay the extra $10/month to avoid hassles (until EL pulls the plug on M=
ailStation entirely).  My mom was always scrambling to save a buck, as are =
most seniors on fixed incomes.

@Jon K.--- wh=

 if it's needed.  You can e-mail me directly if you want or post it in repl=

YES, Earthlink is no longer supporting the Mailstations. But they are NOT
actively trying to close those accounts (that I am aware of). They will
just NOT open a new mailstation account or can no longer swap mailstations
on an account (if yours is broken). That is because the special
mailstation server that they had setup is no longer running to be able to
do that.

But you can use the Mailstation account just like any other Earthlink
webmail account or dial-up email account.  It uses the same SMTP and POP3
protocols Gmail or others use.

I do wish they would allow others to see the programming on the
mailstation devices, so we could then keep existing accounts running, and
install units on new accounts.

If you are going to continue to use Earthlink as the "dial-up" Service
provider, then you would have the following settings.

1. For the connection for the ISP: (on Earthlink)

The Dial-up telephone number;
The Dial-up User Name;
The Dial-up Password;
The ISP DNS number;

2. For the Actual Email Account: (on Earthlink)

The Email User Name;  (mom@...)
The Email Password;
The Email SMTP server; (smtp.mailstation.com)
The Email POP3 server; (pop.mailstation.com)

If you are going to be using DSL or Cable modem to get your ISP service,
you would not need section 1.

Section 2 is almost worldwide standard for all email client software, even
such as Microsoft Express and Microsoft Outlook. The SMTP server uses Port
25, and the POP3 server uses Port 110.  If you are using another ISP for
Section 1, make sure they are NOT blocking Port 25 on your connection with
them, so you will be able to send out email. Most do block it to eliminate
spam being sent out on their system, and to get you to use their email
service.

Hope this helps ?

Wayne

The project cost me le=

software works just fine. I've got t=

here and I still use in on occasion to transfer files=
 into
the PC.

It's a concept that worked out for my needs. But I'd love to=

do. And I'd =
be glad to work on the designs. I have a variety
of mailstation units here,=
 too. At least three different
varieties, I think, including some CIDCOs. T=
hey all seem to
work with my little box.

Hi,
I have a mailstation 100, I've managed to put it in test mode and I pre=
ssed 2 to do a fast test.
Then the LCD screen cleared and the device never =
returned to an usable state.

There is no indication of activity, I have re=
seted it, disconnected it for several hours, but no luck.

There is a way t=
o restore it to a default state?
I know that if I left it in test mode and =
turn it off and on the machine is still in test mode until I press Q

Rom v=
ersion is 1.08 (from memory) and is a device customized for Telefonica de A=
rgentina.

Regards,
Eduardo.

I don't have any version lower than 2.21, but if we assume the
test mode i=
s the same in your 1.68, then "2 fast test" should
display:

1.Flash       =
     PASS
2.Key              PASS
3.Printer Port     SKIP
4.RAM            =
  PASS
5.ROM             <checksum>

step 5 takes about 15 seconds, and the=
n it displays:

Battery TESTING
Battery Down

at this point I have to hit e=
nter to proceed, and
it adds "FALSE" to display.  (I don't have any battery=
 installed.)

I have to hit enter again to get back to test menu.

Are you =
running on wall power supply, or batteries?????
Could your batteries have d=
ied during the test?????

Is it possible that the brightness got turned down?  

There is a =

No, I've turned it up, down, middle and no luck.
I think that it's a hardwa=
re problem. I was looking for an internal jumper or similar to reset the de=
vice to a factory state.
The weird thing is that it was working until I tri=

I'll try to set up a logic analyzer and I'm=C2=A0goi=
ng to measure Z80 bus or RAM/ROM/dataflash CS signals activity. Perhaps the=
 cold reset circuit is faulty.

There is a thumbwheel on edge of case, and it is easy to tur=

I could make it boot.
I've put a bridge between 6V rail and the positive le=
g of C306.
I know that I'm a little out of spec for 5V components (I'm gett=
ing 5.6V currently). I'll use a 7805 tomorrow until I find a solution for t=
his problem.
I think may be the 74HC74 may be faulty, because the key test =
pass OK for the on/off button but it does not starts when I press it withou=
t the bridge. With the bridge on when I press the button the device behaves=
 as if it were turned off, keyboard don't respond any more but the screen i=
s still on due the bridge.
Do you think that 74HC74 may be burned out or th=
ere are other things that may be bad in the on/off circuit?
Does anybody ha=
s the schematics?

You said you had two units, both behaving strange.
Are you u=
sing the same power supply for both?

I would check that it is not faulty p=
ower supply before replacing
any chips on mailstation board.  Or maybe the =
line voltage is too low (brownout)?

Perhaps the easiest way to to check wo=
uld be to put the AA batteries
in it, and see if that fixes it.  Even if th=

Hi CJ,
I've replaced the power supply for a new one (CIDCO original). The u=
nit that is still working now passes all tests including DTMF and Modem.
Th=
e one that does not boot is still in the same situation, with the bridge on=
 it passes all tests too. May be the old power supply burned the power on/o=
ff circuit.
I'll try with AA batteries, but I would not bet on that works.
=
=C2=A0
I've found the schematics for a 250, I think it;s is very simmilar t=
o 100. Looking at it seems U303(74HC74) or Q304 (2SJ244)=C2=A0 can be the c=
ulprit.
I'll try to activate/deactivate the unit bridging G leg of Q304 to =
check if it works. I'll measure the voltage at G leg pressing On/off switch=
 to see if the flipflop is working ok.
=C2=A0
Regards,
Eduardo.
PS: Thank y=
ou to be so kind to respond my questions.

Yes, it is still slightly al=
ive. There is one here. hehe.

I designed and programmed a device that hook=
s up the USB port
of a PC to the parallel printer port of the Mailstation. =
You
"print" your document to the PC, which captures it and makes
it availab=
le as a .TXT file there. (Don't know if that helps
-- it does NOT go the ot=
her way, for example.)

But they are indeed handy. Cheap, battery powered, =
unlikely
to be stolen or broken, and they work just fine for writing
text d=
ocuments. The central problem I found is that they
don't tie into a server =
with access to modem technology. I
suppose I could write server code that w=
ould operate
correctly with their email capabilities, but then the problem
=
becomes one of finding any modem-based internet service. It
costs a lot of =
money to support a dial-up connection these
days. Even if the software coul=
d be written to handle it.

About 10 years ago when I was still on dial up I converted my mailstation t=
o connect with my dial up internet provider and connect to yahoo email.
I o=
nly used it as a backup when my power was out as it really was quite inferi=
or to a real computer.
These days I recommend that people pick up a used co=
mputer and install Linux on it.It really is quite superior to anything that=
 Microsoft offers and now that they are really spying on users outrageously=
 on the new systems it makes a lot of sense.
People mostly have trouble ins=
talling Linux the first time. I don't think using it such a big jump, altho=
ugh some people might have to keep MS for a short time until the find out w=
hich apps will fill their needs.

Yes, it is still slightly alive. There i=

I designed and programmed a device that hooks up the US=
B port
of a PC to the parallel printer port of the Mailstation. You
"print"=
 your document to the PC, which captures it and makes
it available as a .TX=
T file there. (Don't know if that helps
-- it does NOT go the other way, fo=
r example.)


But they are indeed handy. Cheap, battery powered, unlikely
t=
o be stolen or broken, and they work just fine for writing
text documents. =
The central problem I found is that they
don't tie into a server with acces=
s to modem technology. I
suppose I could write server code that would opera=
te
correctly with their email capabilities, but then the problem
becomes on=
e of finding any modem-based internet service. It

IIRC, they offer free d=
ialup access which would be fine for a Mailstation
*IF* you could configure=
 it to the local number/login/password.

I think you're limited to 30 minut=
es/day but that would be fine too.

Hmm. I'll look it over. That page isn't immediately obvio=

the Mailstation was sold through channels with different

Hmm. That would be sufficient, I'd =
imagine. It would need to
support the same protocols. But it probably does.=
 (I'm just
ignorant about the details used by the Mailstation itself for
ma=
il transfers: POP3?)

I picked up a nearly mint mailstation a few weeks ago at a
hamfest. It came=
 in it's original carrying case with all
it's books, cables, looks brand ne=
w.
Is there any ham radio uses for it? I figure someone
has come up with so=
me interesting hacks for it.

Ah, the plans we had for the Mailstation.  Weren't we going to make a 
cool, portable, battery operated  CP/M box? IIRC we couldn't get ram 
mapped into the required address range.  I do remember getting Cyrano's 
debugger running on my hardware.  I looked on ebay and it appears that 
Mailstations go for about $ zero these days.  I am retiring on Monday 
and going on a massive downsizing jag. Looks like the Mailstations are 
going in the recycling pile and not in the ebay store.  Oh well.
